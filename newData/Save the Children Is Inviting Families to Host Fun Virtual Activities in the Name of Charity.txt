Save the Children Bridge the Gap Campaign

How to Help Bridge the Gap for Children in Poverty
Save the Children Bridge the Gap Campaign

One in four children in rural America is living in poverty, and with it comes food insecurity, as well as a lack of educational and community resources to turn to. But Save the Children is here to help—and it has some fun and easy ways you and your family can get involved, too.

Save the Children’s Bridge the Gap campaign is dedicated to closing the gap for kids living in rural America through fundraising and awareness efforts. Currently, two in five children in America do not have access to early learning programs like preschool. Thankfully, Save the Children is active in more than 200 rural communities in 10 states, helping to bring much-needed early childhood educational programs with a focus on the literacy and math skills that have the power to give children the future they deserve. And right now, you can help by partaking in some family-friendly activities and challenges.

On September 26, Save the Children is hosting its Bridge the Gap event. All you need to do is gather a team, choose your own fun activity, register a fundraising page, and help spread the word through social media. One way to get involved on the 26th is to get active—take a walk around your neighborhood, host a virtual workout class, or put some miles on your stationary bike, and get others to pledge donations to support the cause. Or you could take part in a friendly game night challenge: Whether you prefer puzzles, video games, or old-fashioned board games, everyone who signs up to play will pledge to donate to the Bridge the Gap campaign, too. You could also show off your cooking skills by live-streaming a virtual cooking show (each online comment equals a donation pledge) or by challenging a friend to a cook-off, with the winner determined by how many donations that person has collected. Another option is to get creative and design your own activity or challenge to raise funds.

Getting involved is as simple as visiting SaveTheChildren.org/Bridge and registering for a fundraising page to start tracking your donations. You’ll have fun partaking in your activity of choice on September 26, and you can feel good knowing you’re helping an incredible cause and helping to change the lives of children in poverty.
