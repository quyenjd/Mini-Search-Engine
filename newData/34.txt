Procedure for evacuation

Warning of an emergency evacuation will be marked by a number of short bell rings. (In the event of a power failure, this may be a hand-held bell or siren.)
All class work will cease immediately.
Students will leave their bags, books and other possessions where they are.
Teachers will take the class rolls.
Classes will vacate the premises using the nearest staircase. If these stairs are inaccessible, use the nearest alternative staircase. Do not use the lifts. Do not run.
Each class, under the teacherâ€™s supervision, will move in a brisk, orderly fashion to the paved quadrangle area adjacent to the car park.
All support staff will do the same.
The Marshalling Supervisor, Ms Randall, will be wearing a red cap and she will be waiting there with the master timetable and staff list in her possession.
Students assemble in the quad with their teacher at the time of evacuation. The teacher will do a head count and check the roll.
Each teacher sends a student to the Supervisor to report whether all students have been accounted for. After checking, students will sit down (in the event of rain or wet pavement they may remain standing).
The Supervisor will inform the Office when all staff and students have been accounted for.
All students, teaching staff and support personnel remain in the evacuation area until the All Clear signal is given.
The All Clear will be a long bell ring or three blasts on the siren.
Students will return to class in an orderly manner under teacher guidance.
In the event of an emergency occurring during lunch or breaks, students are to assemble in their home-room groups in the quad and await their home-room teacher.
