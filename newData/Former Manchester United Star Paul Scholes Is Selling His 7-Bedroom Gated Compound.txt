Former Manchester United and England soccer star Paul Scholes is selling his sprawling mansion, complete with a plethora of sporting amenities, including, fittingly, a soccer pitch and a putting green.
The seven-bedroom gated compound, in the village of Grasscroft in Greater Manchester, hit the market Monday asking £3.85 million (US$4.9 million).

Spanning roughly 13,000 square feet, the contemporary spread was completely refurbished and redesigned in 2015, according to the listing with estate agency Kirkham Property, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The heart of the home is the open-plan kitchen, dining and family room, the listing said. There’s also a double-height entrance hall, a statement staircase, a lounge with a bar, a games room and a formal dining room.
The lower ground floor is home to the property’s leisure facilities, including a heated swimming pool, a steam room, a gym and a home cinema.


Landscaped gardens surround the property, which are joined by patio areas for al fresco dining, a putting green and golf tee net, a five-a-side football pitch and a netball area.
It’s not clear how long Mr. Scholes, 45, has owned the home, or how much he bought it for.

The retired midfielder and Manchester-native played for the Red Devils for the entirety of his 20-year career before hanging up his boots in 2013.
In 2014, he joined a handful of his former Manchester United teammates to purchase local Manchester team Salford City F.C.
Mr. Scholes, Nicky Butt, Ryan Giggs, Gary Neville and Phil Neville each own 10% of the club alongside businessman Peter Lim, who owns the rest. In 2019, they were joined by another legendary former teammate, David Beckham, who bought his own 10% share from Mr. Lim.
Mr. Scholes could not be reached for comment.
The Daily Mail first reported the listing.
