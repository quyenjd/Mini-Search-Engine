<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p>The English language is peculiarly rich in synonyms, as, with
such a history, it could not fail to be. From the time of Julius
C&aelig;sar, Britons, Romans, Northmen, Saxons, Danes, and Normans
fighting, fortifying, and settling upon the soil of England, with
Scotch and Irish contending for mastery or existence across the
mountain border and the Channel, and all fenced in together by the
sea, could not but influence each other's speech. English merchants,
sailors, soldiers, and travelers, trading, warring, and exploring in
every clime, of necessity brought back new terms of sea and
shore, of shop and camp and battlefield. English scholars have
studied Greek and Latin for a thousand years, and the languages
of the Continent and of the Orient in more recent times. English
churchmen have introduced words from Hebrew, Greek, and
Latin, through Bible and prayer-book, sermon and tract. From
all this it results that there is scarcely a language ever spoken
among men that has not some representative in English speech.
The spirit of the Anglo-Saxon race, masterful in language as in
war and commerce, has subjugated all these various elements to
one idiom, making not a patchwork, but a composite language.
Anglo-Saxon thrift, finding often several words that originally expressed
the same idea, has detailed them to different parts of the
common territory or to different service, so that we have an almost
unexampled variety of words, kindred in meaning but distinct in
usage, for expressing almost every shade of human thought.</p>

<p>Scarcely any two of such words, commonly known as synonyms,
are identical at once in signification and in use. They have certain
common ground within which they are interchangeable; but outside
of that each has its own special province, within which
any other word comes as an intruder. From these two qualities
arises the great value of synonyms as contributing to beauty and
effectiveness of expression. As interchangeable, they make possible
that freedom and variety by which the diction of an accomplished
writer or speaker differs from the wooden uniformity of a
legal document. As distinct and specific, they enable a master of
style to choose in every instance the one term that is the most<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
perfect mirror of his thought. To write or speak to the best purpose,
one should know in the first place all the words from which
he may choose, and then the exact reason why in any case any
particular word should be chosen. To give such knowledge in
these two directions is the office of a book of synonyms.</p>

<p>Of Milton's diction Macaulay writes:</p>

<div class="bq1"><p>"His poetry acts like an incantation. Its merit lies less in its obvious meaning
than in its occult power. There would seem, at first sight, to be no more in his
words than in other words. But they are words of enchantment. No sooner are
they pronounced, than the past is present and the distant near. New forms of beauty
start at once into existence, and all the burial places of the memory give up their
dead. Change the structure of the sentence; <i>substitute one synonym for another</i>, and
the whole effect is destroyed. The spell loses its power; and he who should then
hope to conjure with it would find himself as much mistaken as Cassim in the
Arabian tale, when he stood crying, 'Open Wheat,' 'Open Barley,' to the door which
obeyed no sound but 'Open Sesame.' The miserable failure of Dryden in his attempt
to translate into his own diction some parts of the 'Paradise Lost' is a remarkable
instance of this."</p></div>

<p>Macaulay's own writings abound in examples of that exquisite
precision in the choice of words, which never seems to be precise,
but has all the aspect of absolute freedom. Through his language
his thought bursts upon the mind as a landscape is seen instantly,
perfectly, and beautifully from a mountain height. A
little vagueness of thought, a slight infelicity in the choice of
words would be like a cloud upon the mountain, obscuring the
scene with a damp and chilling mist. Let anyone try the experiment
with a poem like Gray's "Elegy," or Goldsmith's "Traveller"
or "Deserted Village," of substituting other words for those
the poet has chosen, and he will readily perceive how much of
the charm of the lines depends upon their fine exactitude of
expression.</p>

<p>In our own day, when so many are eager to write, and confident
that they can write, and when the press is sending forth by
the ton that which is called literature, but which somehow lacks
the imprint of immortality, it is of the first importance to revive
the study of synonyms as a distinct branch of rhetorical culture.
Prevalent errors need at times to be noted and corrected, but the
teaching of pure English speech is the best defense against all that
is inferior, unsuitable, or repulsive. The most effective condemnation
of an objectionable word or phrase is that it is not found in
scholarly works, and a student who has once learned the rich
stores of vigorous, beautiful, exact, and expressive words that
make up our noble language, is by that very fact put beyond the
reach of all temptation to linguistic corruption.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span></p>

<p>Special instruction in the use of synonyms is necessary, for the
reason that few students possess the analytical power and habit
of mind required to hold a succession of separate definitions in
thought at once, compare them with each other, and determine
just where and how they part company; and the persons least
able to do this are the very ones most in need of the information.
The distinctions between words similar in meaning are often so
fine and elusive as to tax the ingenuity of the accomplished
scholar; yet when clearly apprehended they are as important for
the purposes of language as the minute differences between similar
substances are for the purposes of chemistry. Often definition
itself is best secured by the comparison of kindred terms and
the pointing out where each differs from the other. We perceive
more clearly and remember better what each word is, by
perceiving where each divides from another of kindred meaning;
just as we see and remember better the situation and contour of
adjacent countries, by considering them as boundaries of each
other, rather than by an exact statement of the latitude and
longitude of each as a separate portion of the earth's surface.</p>

<p>The great mass of untrained speakers and writers need to be reminded,
in the first place, <i>that there are synonyms</i>&mdash;a suggestion
which they would not gain from any precision of separate definitions
in a dictionary. The deplorable repetition with which many
slightly educated persons use such words as "elegant," "splendid,"
"clever," "awful," "horrid," etc., to indicate (for they can not be
said to express) almost any shade of certain approved or objectionable
qualities, shows a limited vocabulary, a poverty of language,
which it is of the first importance to correct. Many who are not
given to such gross misuse would yet be surprised to learn how
often they employ a very limited number of words in the attempt
to give utterance to thoughts and feelings so unlike, that what is
the right word on one occasion must of necessity be the wrong
word at many other times. Such persons are simply unconscious
of the fact that there are other words of kindred meaning from
which they might choose; as the United States surveyors of
Alaska found "the shuddering tenant of the frigid zone" wrapping
himself in furs and cowering over a fire of sticks with
untouched coal-mines beneath his feet.</p>

<p>Such poverty of language is always accompanied with poverty
of thought. One who is content to use the same word for widely
different ideas has either never observed or soon comes to forget
that there is any difference between the ideas; or perhaps he retains<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
a vague notion of a difference which he never attempts to define to
himself, and dimly hints to others by adding to his inadequate
word some such phrase as "you see" or "you know," in the helpless
attempt to inject into another mind by suggestion what adequate
words would enable him simply and distinctly to say. Such
a mind resembles the old maps of Africa in which the interior was
filled with cloudy spaces, where modern discovery has revealed
great lakes, fertile plains, and mighty rivers. One main office of
a book of synonyms is to reveal to such persons the unsuspected
riches of their own language; and when a series of words is given
them, from which they may choose, then, with intelligent choice of
words there comes of necessity a clearer perception of the difference
of the ideas that are to be expressed by those different
words. Thus, copiousness and clearness of language tend directly
to affluence and precision of thought.</p>

<p>Hence there is an important use for mere lists of classified synonyms,
like Roget's Thesaurus and the works of Soule and Fallows.
Not one in a thousand of average students would ever discover,
by independent study of the dictionary, that there are fifteen
synonyms for <i>beautiful</i>, twenty-one for <i>beginning</i>, fifteen
for <i>benevolence</i>, twenty for <i>friendly</i>, and thirty-seven for <i>pure</i>.
The mere mention of such numbers opens vistas of possible fulness,
freedom, and variety of utterance, which will have for many
persons the effect of a revelation.</p>

<p>But it is equally important to teach <i>that synonyms are not
identical</i> and to explain why and how they differ. A person of
extensive reading and study, with a fine natural sense of language,
will often find all that he wants in the mere list, which recalls to
his memory the appropriate word. But for the vast majority
there is needed some work that compares or contrasts synonymous
words, explains their differences of meaning or usage, and shows
in what connections one or the other may be most fitly used. This
is the purpose of the present work, to be a guide to selection from
the varied treasures of English speech.</p>

<p>This work treats within 375 pages more than 7500 synonyms.
It has been the study of the author to give every definition or
distinction in the fewest possible words consistent with clearness
of statement, and this not merely for economy of space, but
because such condensed statements are most easily apprehended
and remembered.</p>

<p>The method followed has been to select from every group of synonyms
one word, or two contrasted words, the meaning of which<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
may be settled by clear definitive statement, thus securing some
fixed point or points to which all the other words of the group may
be referred. The great source of vagueness, error, and perplexity in
many discussions of synonyms is, that the writer merely associates
stray ideas loosely connected with the different words, sliding from
synonym to synonym with no definite point of departure or return,
so that a smooth and at first sight pleasing statement really gives the
mind no definite resting-place and no sure conclusion. A true discussion
of synonyms is definition by comparison, and for this there
must be something definite with which to compare. When the
standard is settled, approximation or differentiation can be determined
with clearness and certainty. It is not enough to tell something
about each word. The thing to tell is how each word is
related to others of that particular group. When a word has more
than one prominent meaning, the synonyms for one signification
are treated in one group and a reference is made to some other
group in which the synonyms for another signification are treated,
as may be seen by noting the synonyms given under <span class="smcl"><a href="#APPARENT">APPARENT</a></span>, and
following the reference to <span class="smcl"><a href="#EVIDENT">EVIDENT</a></span>.</p>

<p>It has been impossible within the limits of this volume to treat
in full all the words of each group of synonyms. Sometimes it
has been necessary to restrict the statement to a mere suggestion
of the correct use; in some cases only the chief words of a group
could be considered, giving the key to the discussion, and leaving
the student to follow out the principle in the case of other words
by reference to the definitive statements of the dictionary. It is to
be hoped that at some time a dictionary of synonyms may be prepared,
giving as full a list as that of Roget or of Soule, with discriminating
remarks upon every word. Such a work would be of
the greatest value, but obviously beyond the scope of a text-book
for the class-room.</p>

<p>The author has here incorporated, by permission of the publishers
of the Standard Dictionary, much of the synonym matter
prepared by him for that work. All has been thoroughly revised
or reconstructed, and much wholly new matter has been added.</p>

<p>The book contains also more than 3700 antonyms. These are
valuable as supplying definition by contrast or by negation, one of
the most effective methods of defining being in many cases to tell
what a thing is not. To speakers and writers antonyms are useful
as furnishing oftentimes effective antitheses.</p>

<p>Young writers will find much help from the indication of the
correct use of prepositions, the misuse of which is one of the most<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
common of errors, and one of the most difficult to avoid, while
their right use gives to style cohesion, firmness, and compactness,
and is an important aid to perspicuity. To the text of the synonyms
is appended a set of Questions and Examples to adapt the
work for use as a text-book. Aside from the purposes of the class-room,
this portion will be found of value to the individual student.
Excepting those who have made a thorough study of language
most persons will discover with surprise how difficult it is to
answer any set of the Questions or to fill the blanks in the Examples
without referring to the synonym treatment in Part I., or
to a dictionary, and how rarely they can give any intelligent
reason for preference even among familiar words. There are few
who can study such a work without finding occasion to correct
some errors into which they have unconsciously fallen, and without
coming to a new delight in the use of language from a fuller
knowledge of its resources and a clearer sense of its various
capabilities.</p>

<p><i>Abandon</i> is a word of wide signification, applying to persons
or things of any kind; <i>abdicate</i> and <i>resign</i> apply to office, authority,
or power; <i>cede</i> to territorial possessions; <i>surrender</i> especially
to military force, and more generally to any demand, claim, passion,
etc. <i>Quit</i> carries an idea of suddenness or abruptness not necessarily
implied in <i>abandon</i>, and may not have the same suggestion
of finality. The king <i>abdicates</i> his throne, <i>cedes</i> his territory,
<i>deserts</i> his followers, <i>renounces</i> his religion, <i>relinquishes</i> his titles,
<i>abandons</i> his designs. A cowardly officer <i>deserts</i> his ship; the
helpless passengers <i>abandon</i> it. We <i>quit</i> business, <i>give up</i> property,
<i>resign</i> office, <i>abandon</i> a habit or a trust. <i>Relinquish</i> commonly
implies reluctance; the fainting hand <i>relinquishes</i> its
grasp; the creditor <i>relinquishes</i> his claim. <i>Abandon</i> implies
previous association with responsibility for or control of; <i>forsake</i>
implies previous association with inclination or attachment, real
or assumed; a man may <i>abandon</i> or <i>forsake</i> house or friends;
he <i>abandons</i> an enterprise; <i>forsakes</i> God. <i>Abandon</i> is applied
to both good and evil action; a thief <i>abandons</i> his designs, a
man his principles. <i>Forsake</i>, like <i>abandon</i>, may be used either
in the favorable or unfavorable sense; <i>desert</i> is always unfavorable,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
involving a breach of duty, except when used of
mere localities; as, "the Deserted Village." While a monarch
<i>abdicates</i>, a president or other elected or appointed officer
<i>resigns</i>. It was held that James II. <i>abdicated</i> his throne by
<i>deserting</i> it.</p>

<p><i>Abase</i> refers only to outward conditions. "Exalt him that is
low, and <i>abase</i> him that is high." <i>Ezek.</i> xxi, 26. <i>Debase</i> applies
to quality or character. The coinage is <i>debased</i> by excess of
alloy, the man by vice. <i>Humble</i> in present use refers chiefly to
feeling of heart; <i>humiliate</i> to outward conditions; even when
one is said to <i>humble</i> himself, he either has or affects to have
humility of heart. To <i>disgrace</i> may be to bring or inflict odium
upon others, but the word is chiefly and increasingly applied to
such moral odium as one by his own acts brings upon himself; the
noun <i>disgrace</i> retains more of the passive sense than the verb; he
<i>disgraced</i> himself by his conduct; he brought <i>disgrace</i> upon his
family. To <i>dishonor</i> a person is to deprive him of honor that
should or might be given. To <i>discredit</i> one is to injure his reputation,
as for veracity or solvency. A sense of unworthiness
<i>humbles</i>; a shameful insult <i>humiliates</i>; imprisonment for crime
<i>disgraces</i>. <i>Degrade</i> may refer to either station or character.
An officer is <i>degraded</i> by being <i>reduced</i> to the ranks, <i>disgraced</i>
by cowardice; vile practises <i>degrade</i>; drunkenness is a <i>degrading</i>
vice. Misfortune or injustice may <i>abase</i> the good; nothing but
their own ill-doing can <i>debase</i> or <i>disgrace</i> them.</p>

<p>Any sense of inferiority <i>abashes</i>, with or without the sense
of wrong. The poor are <i>abashed</i> at the splendor of wealth, the
ignorant at the learning of the wise. "I might have been <i>abashed</i>
by their authority." <span class="smc">Gladstone</span> <i>Homeric Synchron.</i>, p. 72. [<span class="smcl">H.</span>
'76.] To <i>confuse</i> is to bring into a state of mental bewilderment;
to <i>confound</i> is to overwhelm the mental faculties; to <i>daunt</i> is to
subject to a certain degree of fear. <i>Embarrass</i> is a strong word,
signifying primarily hamper, hinder, impede. A solitary thinker
may be <i>confused</i> by some difficulty in a subject, or some mental
defect; one is <i>embarrassed</i> in the presence of others, and because
of their presence. Confusion is of the intellect, embarrassment
of the feelings. A witness may be <i>embarrassed</i> by annoying
personalities, so as to become <i>confused</i> in statements. To <i>mortify</i>
a person is to bring upon him a painful sense of humiliation,
whether because of his own or another's fault or failure. A pupil
is <i>confused</i> by a perplexing question, a general <i>confounded</i> by
overwhelming defeat. A hostess is <i>discomposed</i> by the tardiness
of guests, a speaker <i>disconcerted</i> by a failure of memory. The
criminal who is not <i>abashed</i> at detection may be <i>daunted</i> by the
officer's weapon. Sudden joy may <i>bewilder</i>, but will not <i>abash</i>.
The true worshiper is <i>humbled</i> rather than <i>abashed</i> before God.
The parent is <i>mortified</i> by the child's rudeness, the child <i>abashed</i>
at the parent's reproof. The <i>embarrassed</i> speaker finds it difficult
to proceed. The mob is <i>overawed</i> by the military, the hypocrite
<i>shamed</i> by exposure. "A man whom no denial, no scorn could

<p><i>Abet</i> and <i>instigate</i> are now used almost without exception in
a bad sense; one may <i>incite</i> either to good or evil. One <i>incites</i>
or <i>instigates</i> to the doing of something not yet done, or to increased
activity or further advance in the doing of it; one <i>abets</i>
by giving sympathy, countenance, or substantial aid to the doing
of that which is already projected or in process of commission.
<i>Abet</i> and <i>instigate</i> apply either to persons or actions, <i>incite</i> to
persons only; one <i>incites</i> a person <i>to</i> an action. A clergyman
will <i>advocate</i> the claims of justice, <i>aid</i> the poor, <i>encourage</i> the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>

<p><i>Abolish</i>, to do away with, bring absolutely to an end, especially
as something hostile, hindering, or harmful, was formerly used of
persons and material objects, a usage now obsolete except in
poetry or highly figurative speech. <i>Abolish</i> is now used of
institutions, customs, and conditions, especially those wide-spread
and long existing; as, to <i>abolish</i> slavery, ignorance, intemperance,
poverty. A building that is burned to the ground is said to be
<i>destroyed</i> by fire. <i>Annihilate</i>, as a philosophical term, signifies
to put absolutely out of existence. As far as our knowledge goes,
matter is never <i>annihilated</i>, but only changes its form. Some
believe that the wicked will be <i>annihilated</i>. <i>Abolish</i> is not said
of laws. There we use <i>repeal</i>, <i>abrogate</i>, <i>nullify</i>, etc.: <i>repeal</i> by
the enacting body, <i>nullify</i> by revolutionary proceedings; a later
statute <i>abrogates</i>, without formally <i>repealing</i>, any earlier law
with which it conflicts. An appellate court may <i>reverse</i> or <i>set
aside</i> the decision of an inferior court. <i>Overthrow</i> may be used
in either a good or a bad sense; <i>suppress</i> is commonly in a good,
<i>subvert</i> always in a bad sense; as, to <i>subvert</i> our liberties;
to <i>suppress</i> a rebellion. The law <i>prohibits</i> what may never

<i>Luke</i> xvi, 15. The word is oftener applied to the object of such
<i>aversion</i> or <i>abhorrence</i> than to the state of mind that so regards
it; in common use <i>abomination</i> signifies something very much
disliked or loathed, or that deserves to be. Choice food may be
an object of <i>aversion</i> and <i>disgust</i> to a sick person; vile food
would be an <i>abomination</i>. A toad is to many an object of
<i>disgust</i>; a foul sewer is an <i>abomination</i>. As applied to crimes,
<i>abomination</i> is used of such as are especially brutal, shameful, or
revolting; theft is an <i>offense</i>; infanticide is an <i>abomination</i>.</p>

<p>In the strict sense, <i>absolute</i>, free from all limitation or control,
and <i>supreme</i>, superior to all, can not properly be said of any being
except the divine. Both words are used, however, in a modified
sense, of human authorities; <i>absolute</i> then signifying free from
limitation by other authority, and <i>supreme</i> exalted over all other;
as, an <i>absolute</i> monarch, the <i>supreme</i> court. <i>Absolute</i>, in this
use, does not necessarily carry any unfavorable sense, but as <i>absolute</i>
power in human hands is always abused, the unfavorable
meaning predominates. <i>Autocratic</i> power knows no limits outside
the ruler's self; <i>arbitrary</i> power, none outside the ruler's will
or judgment, <i>arbitrary</i> carrying the implication of wilfulness
and capriciousness. <i>Despotic</i> is commonly applied to a masterful
or severe use of power, which is expressed more decidedly by
<i>tyrannical</i>. <i>Arbitrary</i> may be used in a good sense; as, the pronunciation
of proper names is <i>arbitrary</i>; but the bad sense is
the prevailing one; as, an <i>arbitrary</i> proceeding. <i>Irresponsible</i>
power is not necessarily bad, but eminently dangerous; an executor
or trustee should not be <i>irresponsible</i>; an <i>irresponsible</i> ruler
is likely to be <i>tyrannical</i>. A perfect ruler might be <i>irresponsible</i>
and not <i>tyrannical</i>. <i>Authoritative</i> is used always in a good
sense, implying the right to claim authority; <i>imperative</i>, <i>peremptory</i>,
and <i>positive</i> are used ordinarily in the good sense; as, an
<i>authoritative</i> definition; an <i>imperative</i> demand; a <i>peremptory</i>
command; <i>positive</i> instructions; <i>imperious</i> signifies assuming
and determined to command, rigorously requiring obedience. An
<i>imperious</i> demand or requirement may have in it nothing offensive;
it is simply one that resolutely insists upon compliance, and
will not brook refusal; an <i>arrogant</i> demand is offensive by its
tone of superiority, an <i>arbitrary</i> demand by its unreasonableness;
an <i>imperious</i> disposition is liable to become <i>arbitrary</i> and <i>arrogant</i>.
A person of an independent spirit is inclined to resent an
<i>imperious</i> manner in any one, especially in one whose superiority
is not clearly recognized. <i>Commanding</i> is always used in a good<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sense; as, a <i>commanding</i> appearance; a <i>commanding</i> eminence.

an <i>abettor</i> (the general legal spelling) is always present, either

never. If present, though only to stand outside and keep watch

<p>An <i>accident</i> is that which happens without any one's direct intention;
a <i>chance</i> that which happens without any known cause.
If the direct cause of a railroad <i>accident</i> is known, we can not
call it a <i>chance</i>. To the theist there is, in strictness, no <i>chance</i>,
all things being by divine causation and control; but <i>chance</i> is
spoken of where no special cause is manifest: "By <i>chance</i> there
came down a certain priest that way," <i>Luke</i> x, 31. We can speak
of a game of <i>chance</i>, but not of a game of <i>accident</i>. An <i>incident</i>
is viewed as occurring in the regular course of things, but subordinate
to the main purpose, or aside from the main design. <i>Fortune</i>
is the result of inscrutable controlling forces. <i>Fortune</i> and
<i>chance</i> are nearly equivalent, but <i>chance</i> can be used of human
effort and endeavor as <i>fortune</i> can not be; we say "he has a
<i>chance</i> of success," or "there is one <i>chance</i> in a thousand," where
we could not substitute <i>fortune</i>; as personified, <i>Fortune</i> is regarded
as having a fitful purpose, <i>Chance</i> as purposeless; we
speak of fickle <i>Fortune</i>, blind <i>Chance</i>; "<i>Fortune</i> favors the
brave." The slaughter of men is an <i>incident</i> of battle; unexpected
defeat, the <i>fortune</i> of war. Since the unintended is often the undesirable,
<i>accident</i> tends to signify some <i>calamity</i> or <i>disaster</i>, unless
the contrary is expressed, as when we say a fortunate or
happy <i>accident</i>. An <i>adventure</i> is that which may turn out ill, a
<i>misadventure</i> that which does turn out ill. A slight disturbing
<i>accident</i> is a <i>mishap</i>. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#EVENT">EVENT</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#HAZARD">HAZARD</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Acquaintance</i> between persons supposes that each knows the
other; we may know a public man by his writings or speeches,
and by sight, but can not claim <i>acquaintance</i> unless he personally
knows us. There may be pleasant <i>acquaintance</i> with little <i>companionship</i>;
and conversely, much <i>companionship</i> with little
<i>acquaintance</i>, as between busy clerks at adjoining desks. So
there may be <i>association</i> in business without <i>intimacy</i> or <i>friendship</i>.
<i>Acquaintance</i> admits of many degrees, from a slight or
passing to a familiar or intimate <i>acquaintance</i>; but <i>acquaintance</i>
unmodified commonly signifies less than <i>familiarity</i> or <i>intimacy</i>.
As regards persons, <i>familiarity</i> is becoming restricted to the undesirable
sense, as in the proverb, "<i>Familiarity</i> breeds contempt;"
hence, in personal relations, the word <i>intimacy</i>, which
refers to mutual knowledge of thought and feeling, is now uniformly
preferred. <i>Friendship</i> includes <i>acquaintance</i> with some
degree of <i>intimacy</i>, and ordinarily <i>companionship</i>, though in a
wider sense <i>friendship</i> may exist between those who have never
met, but know each other only by word and deed. <i>Acquaintance</i>
does not involve <i>friendship</i>, for one may be well acquainted with
an enemy. <i>Fellowship</i> involves not merely <i>acquaintance</i> and
<i>companionship</i>, but sympathy as well. There may be much
<i>friendship</i> without much <i>fellowship</i>, as between those whose
homes or pursuits are far apart. There may be pleasant <i>fellowship</i>
which does not reach the fulness of <i>friendship</i>. Compare

<p>An <i>act</i> is strictly and originally something accomplished by an
exercise of power, in which sense it is synonymous with <i>deed</i> or
<i>effect</i>. <i>Action</i> is a <i>doing</i>. <i>Act</i> is therefore single, individual,
momentary; <i>action</i> a complex of <i>acts</i>, or a process, state, or habit
of exerting power. We say a virtuous <i>act</i>, but rather a virtuous
course of <i>action</i>. We speak of the <i>action</i> of an acid upon a
metal, not of its <i>act</i>. <i>Act</i> is used, also, for the simple <i>exertion</i> of
power; as, an <i>act</i> of will. In this sense an <i>act</i> does not necessarily
imply an external <i>effect</i>, while an <i>action</i> does. Morally, the
<i>act</i> of murder is in the determination to kill; legally, the <i>act</i> is
not complete without the striking of the fatal blow. <i>Act</i> and
<i>deed</i> are both used for the thing done, but <i>act</i> refers to the power
put forth, <i>deed</i> to the result accomplished; as, a voluntary <i>act</i>, a
bad <i>deed</i>. In connection with other words <i>act</i> is more usually
qualified by the use of another noun, <i>action</i> by an adjective preceding;
we may say a kind <i>act</i>, though oftener an <i>act</i> of kindness,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
but only a kind <i>action</i>, not an <i>action</i> of kindness. As between
<i>act</i> and <i>deed</i>, <i>deed</i> is commonly used of great, notable, and impressive
<i>acts</i>, as are <i>achievement</i>, <i>exploit</i>, and <i>feat</i>.</p>

<p class="noin">A <i>feat</i> exhibits strength, skill, personal power, whether mental or

An <i>exploit</i> is a conspicuous or glorious <i>deed</i>, involving valor

thought, and readiness of resource; an <i>achievement</i> is the doing
of something great and noteworthy; an <i>exploit</i> is brilliant, but its
effect may be transient; an <i>achievement</i> is solid, and its effect
enduring. <i>Act</i> and <i>action</i> are both in contrast to all that is merely
passive and receptive. The intensest <i>action</i> is easier than passive
endurance.</p>

<p><i>Sharpness</i>, <i>acuteness</i>, and <i>insight</i>, however keen, and <i>penetration</i>,
however deep, fall short of the meaning of <i>acumen</i>, which
implies also ability to use these qualities to advantage. There are
persons of keen <i>insight</i> and great <i>penetration</i> to whom these
powers are practically useless. <i>Acumen</i> is <i>sharpness</i> to some
purpose, and belongs to a mind that is comprehensive as well as
keen. <i>Cleverness</i> is a practical aptitude for study or learning.
<i>Insight</i> and <i>discernment</i> are applied oftenest to the judgment of
character; <i>penetration</i> and <i>perspicacity</i> to other subjects of
knowledge. <i>Sagacity</i> is an uncultured skill in using quick perceptions
for a desired end, generally in practical affairs; <i>acumen</i>
may increase with study, and applies to the most erudite matters.
<i>Shrewdness</i> is <i>keenness</i> or <i>sagacity</i>, often with a somewhat evil
bias, as ready to take advantage of duller intellects. <i>Perspicacity</i>
is the power to see clearly through that which is difficult or involved.
We speak of the <i>acuteness</i> of an observer or a reasoner,
the <i>insight</i> and <i>discernment</i> of a student, a clergyman, or a merchant,
the <i>sagacity</i> of a hound, the <i>keenness</i> of a debater, the

<p>One is <i>addicted</i> to that which he has allowed to gain a strong,
habitual, and enduring hold upon action, inclination, or involuntary
tendency, as to a habit or indulgence. A man may be <i>accustomed</i>
to labor, <i>attached</i> to his profession, <i>devoted</i> to his religion, <i>given</i>
to study or to gluttony (in the bad sense, <i>given over</i>, or <i>given up</i>,
is a stronger and more hopeless expression, as is <i>abandoned</i>). One
<i>inclined</i> to luxury may become <i>habituated</i> to poverty. One is
<i>wedded</i> to that which has become a second nature; as, one is
<i>wedded</i> to science or to art. <i>Prone</i> is used only in a bad sense,
and generally of natural tendencies; as, our hearts are <i>prone</i> to
evil. <i>Abandoned</i> tells of the acquired viciousness of one who has
given himself up to wickedness. <i>Addicted</i> may be used in a
good, but more frequently a bad sense; as, <i>addicted</i> to study;
<i>addicted</i> to drink. <i>Devoted</i> is used chiefly in the good sense; as,

<i>salute</i> is to <i>greet</i> with special token of respect, as a soldier his
commander. To <i>apostrophize</i> is to solemnly <i>address</i> some person
or personified attribute apart from the audience to whom one is
speaking; as, a preacher may <i>apostrophize</i> virtue, the saints of
old, or even the Deity. To <i>appeal</i> is strictly to call for some form
of help or support. <i>Address</i> is slightly more formal than <i>accost</i>

have strength <i>adequate</i> to the work of a porter; but that would
not be a <i>fit</i> or <i>suitable</i> occupation for him. Work is <i>satisfactory</i>
if it satisfies those for whom it is done, though it may be very
poor work judged by some higher standard. <i>Qualified</i> refers to
acquired abilities; <i>competent</i> to both natural and acquired; a

<p>An <i>adherent</i> is one who is devoted or attached to a person,
party, principle, cause, creed, or the like. One may be an <i>aider</i>
and <i>supporter</i> of a party or church, while not an <i>adherent</i> to all
its doctrines or claims. An <i>ally</i> is more independent still, as he
may differ on every point except the specific ground of union.
The <i>Allies</i> who overthrew Napoleon were united only against him.
<i>Allies</i> are regarded as equals; <i>adherents</i> and <i>disciples</i> are followers.
The <i>adherent</i> depends more on his individual judgment, the
<i>disciple</i> is more subject to command and instruction; thus we say
the <i>disciples</i> rather than the <i>adherents</i> of Christ. <i>Partisan</i> has<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the narrow and odious sense of adhesion to a party, right or

<i>Contiguous</i> may be used for either <i>adjacent</i> or <i>adjoining</i>. <i>Abutting</i>
refers rather to the end of one building or estate than to the
neighborhood of another. Buildings may be <i>adjacent</i> or <i>adjoining</i>

his narrative with fine descriptions, the artist <i>illustrates</i> it
with beautiful engravings, the binder <i>gilds</i> and <i>decorates</i> the volume.
<i>Garnish</i> is on a lower plane; as, the feast was <i>garnished</i>
with flowers. <i>Deck</i> and <i>bedeck</i> are commonly said of apparel; as,
a mother <i>bedecks</i> her daughter with silk and jewels. To <i>adorn</i>
and to <i>ornament</i> alike signify to add that which makes anything
beautiful and attractive, but <i>ornament</i> is more exclusively on the
material plane; as, the gateway was <i>ornamented</i> with delicate<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
carving. <i>Adorn</i> is more lofty and spiritual, referring to a beauty
which is not material, and can not be put on by ornaments or decorations,
but seems in perfect harmony and unity with that to
which it adds a grace; if we say, the gateway was <i>adorned</i> with
beautiful carving, we imply a unity and loftiness of design such
as <i>ornamented</i> can not express. We say of some admirable scholar

<p><i>Agriculture</i> is the generic term, including at once the science,

bestowed upon the land, as plowing, manuring, etc.; <i>cultivation</i>
refers especially to the processes that bring forward the crop; we
speak of the <i>tillage</i> of the soil, the <i>cultivation</i> of corn; we also

<i>Culture</i> is now applied to the careful development of any product

<p>The <i>aim</i> is the direction in which one shoots, or sometimes
that which is aimed at. The <i>mark</i> is that at which one shoots;
the <i>goal</i>, that toward which one runs. All alike indicate the direction
of <i>endeavor</i>. The <i>end</i> is the point at which one expects or
hopes to close his labors; the <i>object</i>, that which he would grasp as
the reward of his labors. <i>Aspiration</i>, <i>design</i>, <i>endeavor</i>, <i>purpose</i>,
referring to the mental acts by which the <i>aim</i> is attained, are
often used as interchangeable with <i>aim</i>. <i>Aspiration</i> applies to
what are viewed as noble <i>aims</i>; <i>endeavor</i>, <i>design</i>, <i>intention</i>, <i>purpose</i>,
indifferently to the best or worst. <i>Aspiration</i> has less of
decision than the other terms; one may aspire to an <i>object</i>, and
yet lack the fixedness of <i>purpose</i> by which alone it can be attained.
<i>Purpose</i> is stronger than <i>intention</i>. <i>Design</i> especially denotes the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
adaptation of means to an end; <i>endeavor</i> refers to the exertions
by which it is to be attained. One whose <i>aims</i> are worthy, whose
<i>aspirations</i> are high, whose <i>designs</i> are wise, and whose <i>purposes</i>
are steadfast, may hope to reach the <i>goal</i> of his ambition, and will
surely win some <i>object</i> worthy of a life's <i>endeavor</i>. Compare

<p><i>Air</i> is that combination of qualities which makes the entire
impression we receive in a person's presence; as, we say he has the
<i>air</i> of a scholar, or the <i>air</i> of a villain. <i>Appearance</i> refers more
to the dress and other externals. We might say of a travel-soiled
pedestrian, he has the <i>appearance</i> of a tramp, but the <i>air</i> of a gentleman.
<i>Expression</i> and <i>look</i> especially refer to the face. <i>Expression</i>
is oftenest applied to that which is habitual; as, he has a
pleasant <i>expression</i> of countenance; <i>look</i> may be momentary; as, a
<i>look</i> of dismay passed over his face. We may, however, speak of
the <i>look</i> or <i>looks</i> as indicating all that we look at; as, he had the
<i>look</i> of an adventurer; I did not like his <i>looks</i>. <i>Bearing</i> is rather
a lofty word; as, he has a noble <i>bearing</i>; <i>port</i> is practically identical
in meaning with <i>bearing</i>, but is more exclusively a literary
word. <i>Carriage</i>, too, is generally used in a good sense; as, that lady
has a good <i>carriage</i>. <i>Mien</i> is closely synonymous with <i>air</i>, but less
often used in a bad sense. We say a rakish <i>air</i> rather than a rakish
<i>mien</i>. <i>Mien</i> may be used to express some prevailing feeling;
as, "an indignant <i>mien</i>." <i>Demeanor</i> goes beyond <i>appearance</i>,
including conduct, behavior; as, a modest <i>demeanor</i>. <i>Manner</i>
and <i>style</i> are, in large part at least, acquired. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#BEHAVIOR">BEHAVIOR</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Alarm</i>, according to its derivation <i>all'arme</i>, "to arms," is an
arousing to meet and repel danger, and may be quite consistent
with true courage. <i>Affright</i> and <i>fright</i> express sudden <i>fear</i>
which, for the time at least, overwhelms courage. The sentinel
discovers with <i>alarm</i> the sudden approach of the enemy; the unarmed
villagers view it with <i>affright</i>. <i>Apprehension</i>, <i>disquietude</i>,
<i>dread</i>, <i>misgiving</i>, and <i>solicitude</i> are in anticipation of danger;
<i>consternation</i>, <i>dismay</i>, and <i>terror</i> are overwhelming <i>fear</i>, generally
in the actual presence of that which is terrible, though these
words also may have an anticipative force. <i>Timidity</i> is a quality,

<p><i>Alike</i> is a comprehensive word, signifying as applied to two or
more objects that some or all qualities of one are the same as those
of the other or others; by modifiers <i>alike</i> may be made to express
more or less resemblance; as, these houses are somewhat (<i>i. e.</i>,
partially) <i>alike</i>; or, these houses are exactly (<i>i. e.</i>, in all respects)
<i>alike</i>. Cotton and wool are <i>alike</i> in this, that they can both be
woven into cloth. Substances are <i>homogeneous</i> which are made
up of elements of the <i>same</i> kind, or which are the <i>same</i> in structure.
Two pieces of iron may be <i>homogeneous</i> in material, while
not <i>alike</i> in size or shape. In geometry, two triangles are <i>equal</i>
when they can be laid over one another, and fit, line for line and
angle for angle; they are <i>equivalent</i> when they simply contain the
same amount of space. An <i>identical</i> proposition is one that says
the same thing precisely in subject and predicate. <i>Similar</i> refers
to close resemblance, which yet leaves room for question or denial
of complete likeness or identity. To say "this is the <i>identical</i>
man," is to say not merely that he is <i>similar</i> to the one I have in
mind, but that he is the very <i>same</i> person. Things are <i>analogous</i>
when they are <i>similar</i> in idea, plan, use, or character, tho
perhaps quite unlike in appearance; as, the gills of fishes are said
to be <i>analogous</i> to the lungs in terrestrial animals.</p>

<p><i>Allay</i> and <i>alleviate</i> are closely kindred in signification, and
have been often interchanged in usage. But, in strictness, to
<i>allay</i> is to lay to rest, <i>quiet</i> or <i>soothe</i> that which is excited; to <i>alleviate</i>,
on the other hand, is to lighten a burden. We <i>allay</i> suffering
by using means to <i>soothe</i> and <i>tranquilize</i> the sufferer; we
<i>alleviate</i> suffering by doing something toward removal of the
cause, so that there is less to suffer; where the trouble is wholly
or chiefly in the excitement, to <i>allay</i> the excitement is virtually
to remove the trouble; as, to <i>allay</i> rage or panic; we <i>alleviate</i>
poverty, but do not <i>allay</i> it. <i>Pacify</i>, directly from the Latin, and
<i>appease</i>, from the Latin through the French, signify to bring to
peace; to <i>mollify</i> is to soften; to <i>calm</i>, <i>quiet</i>, or <i>tranquilize</i> is to
make still; <i>compose</i>, to place together, unite, adjust to a calm and
settled condition; to <i>soothe</i> (originally to assent to, humor) is to
bring to pleased quietude. We <i>allay</i> excitement, <i>appease</i> a tumult,
<i>calm</i> agitation, <i>compose</i> our feelings or countenance, <i>pacify</i>
the quarrelsome, <i>quiet</i> the boisterous or clamorous, <i>soothe</i> grief or

evidence up to what has been <i>alleged</i>. <i>Adduce</i> is a secondary
word; nothing can be <i>adduced</i> in evidence till something has been
<i>stated</i> or <i>alleged</i>, which the evidence is to sustain. An <i>alleged</i>
fact stands open to question or doubt. To speak of an <i>alleged</i> document,
an <i>alleged</i> will, an <i>alleged</i> crime, is either to question, or
at least very carefully to refrain from admitting, that the document
exists, that the will is genuine, or that the crime has been
committed. <i>Alleged</i> is, however, respectful; to speak of the "so-called"
will or deed, etc., would be to cast discredit upon the document,
and imply that the speaker was ready to brand it as unquestionably
spurious; <i>alleged</i> simply concedes nothing and leaves
the question open. To <i>produce</i> is to bring forward, as, for instance,
papers or persons. <i>Adduce</i> is not used of persons; of them
we say <i>introduce</i> or <i>produce</i>. When an <i>alleged</i> criminal is
brought to trial, the counsel on either side are accustomed to <i>advance</i>
a theory, and <i>adduce</i> the strongest possible evidence in its
support; they will <i>produce</i> documents and witnesses, <i>cite</i> precedents,
<i>assign</i> reasons, <i>introduce</i> suggestions, <i>offer</i> pleas. The accused

<p><i>Allegiance</i> is the obligation of fidelity and obedience that an
individual owes to his government or sovereign, in return for the
protection he receives. The feudal uses of these words have mostly
passed away with the state of society that gave them birth; but
their origin still colors their present meaning. A patriotic American
feels an enthusiastic <i>loyalty</i> to the republic; he takes, on occasion,
an oath of <i>allegiance</i> to the government, but his <i>loyalty</i> will
lead him to do more than mere <i>allegiance</i> could demand; he pays
<i>homage</i> to God alone, as the only king and lord, or to those principles
of right that are spiritually supreme; he acknowledges the
duty of <i>obedience</i> to all rightful authority; he resents the idea of
<i>subjection</i>. <i>Fealty</i> is becoming somewhat rare, except in elevated
or poetic style. We prefer to speak of the <i>faithfulness</i> rather
than the <i>fealty</i> of citizen, wife, or friend.</p>

</table>

<p>In modern usage we may say that an <i>allegory</i> is an extended
<i>simile</i>, while a <i>metaphor</i> is an abbreviated <i>simile</i> contained often
in a phrase, perhaps in a word. The <i>simile</i> carries its comparison
on the surface, in the words <i>as</i>, <i>like</i>, or similar expressions;
the <i>metaphor</i> is given directly without any note of comparison.
The <i>allegory</i>, <i>parable</i>, or <i>fable</i> tells its story as if true, leaving
the reader or hearer to discover its fictitious character and
learn its lesson. All these are, in strict definition, <i>fictions</i>; but the
word <i>fiction</i> is now applied almost exclusively to novels or romances.
An <i>allegory</i> is a moral or religious tale, of which the
moral lesson is the substance, and all descriptions and incidents
but accessories, as in "The Pilgrim's Progress." A <i>fable</i> is generally
briefer, representing animals as the speakers and actors, and
commonly conveying some lesson of practical wisdom or shrewdness,
as "The <i>Fables</i> of &AElig;sop." A <i>parable</i> is exclusively moral
or religious, briefer and less adorned than an <i>allegory</i>, with its lesson
more immediately discernible, given, as it were, at a stroke.
Any comparison, analogy, instance, example, tale, anecdote, or
the like which serves to let in light upon a subject may be called
an <i>illustration</i>, this word in its widest use including all the rest.

<p><i>Alliance</i> is in its most common use a connection formed by

is a mercantile word; <i>alliance</i> chiefly political or matrimonial.
<i>Coalition</i> is oftenest used of political parties; <i>fusion</i>
is now the more common word in this sense. In an <i>alliance</i>
between nations there is no surrender of sovereignty, and no
<i>union</i> except for a specified time and purpose. <i>League</i> and <i>alliance</i>
are used with scarcely perceptible difference of meaning. In
a <i>confederacy</i> or <i>confederation</i> there is an attempt to unite separate
states in a general government without surrender of sovereignty.
<i>Union</i> implies so much concession as to make the separate
states substantially one. <i>Federation</i> is mainly a poetic and rhetorical
word expressing something of the same thought, as in Tennyson's
"<i>federation</i> of the world," <i>Locksley Hall</i>, l. 128. The United
States is not a <i>confederacy</i> nor an <i>alliance</i>; the nation might be

place, or person, but it always has reference to what is considerably
in the future; a man <i>appoints</i> to meet his friend in five minutes;
he <i>destines</i> his son to follow his own profession. <i>Assign</i> is
rarely used of time, but rather of places, persons, or things. We
<i>assign</i> a work to be done and <i>assign</i> a man to do it, who, if he
fails, must <i>assign</i> a reason for not doing it. That which is <i>allotted</i>,
<i>appointed</i>, or <i>assigned</i> is more or less arbitrary; that which is
<i>awarded</i> is the due requital of something the receiver has done,
and he has right and claim to it; as, the medal was <i>awarded</i> for
valor. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#APPORTION">APPORTION</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Alloy</i> may be either some admixture of baser with precious
metal, as for giving hardness to coin or the like, or it may be a
compound or mixture of two or more metals. <i>Adulteration</i>,
<i>debasement</i>, and <i>deterioration</i> are always used in the bad sense;
<i>admixture</i> is neutral, and may be good or bad; <i>alloy</i> is commonly
good in the literal sense. An excess of <i>alloy</i> virtually
amounts to <i>adulteration</i>; but <i>adulteration</i> is now mostly restricted
to articles used for food, drink, medicine, and kindred uses. In
the figurative sense, as applied to character, etc., <i>alloy</i> is unfavorable,

<p><i>Advert</i>, <i>mention</i>, and <i>refer</i> are used of language that more or

from which it may be inferred. We <i>allude</i> to a matter slightly,
perhaps by a word or phrase, as it were in byplay; we <i>advert</i> to
it when we turn from our path to treat it; we <i>refer</i> to it by any
clear utterance that distinctly turns the mind or attention to it;

<p>To <i>allure</i> is to <i>draw</i> as with a lure by some charm or some
prospect of pleasure or advantage. We may <i>attract</i> others to a
certain thing without intent; as, the good unconsciously <i>attract</i>
others to virtue. We may <i>allure</i> either to that which is evil or
to that which is good and noble, by purpose and endeavor, as in
the familiar line, "<i>Allured</i> to brighter worlds, and led the way,"
<span class="smc">Goldsmith</span> <i>Deserted Village</i>, l. 170. <i>Lure</i> is rather more akin to
the physical nature. It is the word we would use of drawing on
an animal. <i>Coax</i> expresses the attraction of the person, not of
the thing. A man may be <i>coaxed</i> to that which is by no means
<i>alluring</i>. <i>Cajole</i> and <i>decoy</i> carry the idea of deceiving and ensnaring.
To <i>inveigle</i> is to lead one blindly in. To <i>tempt</i> is to endeavor
to lead one wrong; to <i>seduce</i> is to succeed in <i>winning</i> one from
good to ill. <i>Win</i> may be used in either a bad or a good sense, in
which latter it surpasses the highest sense of <i>allure</i>, because it
succeeds in that which <i>allure</i> attempts; as, "He that <i>winneth</i>
souls is wise," <i>Prov.</i> xi, 30.</p>

<i>withal</i>, simply add a fact or thought; <i>also</i> (all so), <i>in like manner</i>,
<i>likewise</i>, <i>similarly</i>, affirm that what is added is like that to which

<p>A <i>choice</i> may be among many things; an <i>alternative</i> is in the
strictest sense a <i>choice</i> between two things; oftener it is one of two
things between which a <i>choice</i> is to be made, and either of which
is the <i>alternative</i> of the other; as, the <i>alternative</i> of surrender is
death; or the two things between which there is a <i>choice</i> may be
called the <i>alternatives</i>; both Mill and Gladstone are quoted as extending
the meaning of <i>alternative</i> to include several particulars,
Gladstone even speaking of "the fourth and last of these <i>alternatives</i>."
<i>Option</i> is the right or privilege of choosing; <i>choice</i> may
be either the right to choose, the act of choosing, or the thing
chosen. A person of ability and readiness will commonly have
many <i>resources</i>. <i>Pick</i>, from the Saxon, and <i>election</i>, from the
Latin, picture the objects before one, with freedom and power to
choose which he will; as, there were twelve horses, among which
I could take my <i>pick</i>. A <i>choice</i>, <i>pick</i>, <i>election</i>, or <i>preference</i> is
that which suits one best; an <i>alternative</i> is that to which one is
restricted; a <i>resource</i>, that to which one is glad to betake oneself.</p>

<p>To <i>amass</i> is to bring together materials that make a mass, a
great bulk or quantity. With some occasional exceptions, <i>accumulate</i>
is applied to the more gradual, <i>amass</i> to the more rapid
gathering of money or materials, <i>amass</i> referring to the general
result or bulk, <i>accumulate</i> to the particular process or rate of gain.
We say interest is <i>accumulated</i> (or <i>accumulates</i>) rather than is
<i>amassed</i>; he <i>accumulated</i> a fortune in the course of years; he
rapidly <i>amassed</i> a fortune by shrewd speculations. Goods or
money for immediate distribution are said to be <i>collected</i> rather<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
than <i>amassed</i>. They may be <i>stored up</i> for a longer or shorter

<p>Etymologically, the <i>amateur</i> is one who loves, the <i>connoisseur</i>
one who knows. In usage, the term <i>amateur</i> is applied to one
who pursues any study or art simply from the love of it; the word
carries a natural implication of superficialness, tho marked
excellence is at times attained by <i>amateurs</i>. A <i>connoisseur</i> is
supposed to be so thoroughly informed regarding any art or work
as to be able to criticize or select intelligently and authoritatively;
there are many incompetent <i>critics</i>, but there can not, in the true
sense, be an incompetent <i>connoisseur</i>. The <i>amateur</i> practises to
some extent that in regard to which he may not be well informed;
the <i>connoisseur</i> is well informed in regard to that which he may
not practise at all. A <i>novice</i> or <i>tyro</i> may be a <i>professional</i>; an
<i>amateur</i> never is; the <i>amateur</i> may be skilled and experienced as
the <i>novice</i> or <i>tyro</i> never is. <i>Dilettante</i>, which had originally the
sense of <i>amateur</i>, has to some extent come to denote one who is
superficial, pretentious, and affected, whether in theory or practise.</p>

<p><i>Amazement</i> and <i>astonishment</i> both express the momentary
overwhelming of the mind by that which is beyond expectation.
<i>Astonishment</i> especially affects the emotions, <i>amazement</i> the intellect.
<i>Awe</i> is the yielding of the mind to something supremely<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
grand in character or formidable in power, and ranges from apprehension
or dread to reverent worship. <i>Admiration</i> includes
delight and regard. <i>Surprise</i> lies midway between <i>astonishment</i>
and <i>amazement</i>, and usually respects matters of lighter consequence
or such as are less startling in character. <i>Amazement</i>
may be either pleasing or painful, as when induced by the grandeur
of the mountains, or by the fury of the storm. We can say
pleased <i>surprise</i>, but scarcely pleased <i>astonishment</i>. <i>Amazement</i>
has in it something of <i>confusion</i> or <i>bewilderment</i>; but <i>confusion</i>
and <i>bewilderment</i> may occur without <i>amazement</i>, as when a multitude
of details require instant attention. <i>Astonishment</i> may be
without <i>bewilderment</i> or <i>confusion</i>. <i>Wonder</i> is often pleasing,

</table>

<p><i>Aspiration</i> is the desire for excellence, pure and simple. <i>Ambition</i>,
literally a going around to solicit votes, has primary reference
to the award or approval of others, and is the eager desire of
power, fame, or something deemed great and eminent, and viewed
as a worthy prize. The prizes of <i>aspiration</i> are virtue, nobility,
skill, or other high qualities. The prizes of <i>ambition</i> are advancement,
fame, honor, and the like. There is a noble and wise or an
ignoble, selfish, and harmful <i>ambition</i>. <i>Emulation</i> is not so
much to win any excellence or success for itself as to equal or
surpass other persons. There is such a thing as a noble <i>emulation</i>,
when those we would equal or surpass are noble, and the means
we would use worthy. But, at the highest, <i>emulation</i> is inferior
as a motive to <i>aspiration</i>, which seeks the high quality or character
for its own sake, not with reference to another. <i>Competition</i>
is the striving for something that is sought by another at the
same time. <i>Emulation</i> regards the abstract, <i>competition</i> the concrete;
<i>rivalry</i> is the same in essential meaning with <i>competition</i>,
but differs in the nature of the objects contested for, which, in<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the case of <i>rivalry</i>, are usually of the nobler sort and less subject
to direct gaging, measurement, and rule. We speak of <i>competition</i>
in business, <i>emulation</i> in scholarship, <i>rivalry</i> in love, politics,
etc.; <i>emulation</i> of excellence, success, achievement; <i>competition</i>
for a prize; <i>rivalry</i> between persons or nations. <i>Competition</i>
may be friendly, <i>rivalry</i> is commonly hostile. <i>Opposition</i> is becoming
a frequent substitute for <i>competition</i> in business language;
it implies that the competitor is an opponent and hinderer.</p>

<p>To <i>amend</i> is to change for the better by removing faults, errors,
or defects, and always refers to that which at some point falls
short of a standard of excellence. <i>Advance</i>, <i>better</i>, and <i>improve</i>
may refer either to what is quite imperfect or to what has reached
a high degree of excellence; we <i>advance</i> the kingdom of God, <i>improve</i>
the minds of our children, <i>better</i> the morals of the people.
But for matters below the point of ordinary approval we seldom
use these words; we do not speak of <i>bettering</i> a wretched alley,
or <i>improving</i> a foul sewer. There we use <i>cleanse</i>, <i>purify</i>, or similar
words. We <i>correct</i> evils, <i>reform</i> abuses, <i>rectify</i> incidental
conditions of evil or error; we <i>ameliorate</i> poverty and misery,
which we can not wholly remove. We <i>mend</i> a tool, <i>repair</i> a building,
<i>correct</i> proof; we <i>amend</i> character or conduct that is faulty,
or a statement or law that is defective. A text, writing, or statement
is <i>amended</i> by the author or by some adequate authority; it
is often <i>emended</i> by conjecture. A motion is <i>amended</i> by the
mover or by the assembly; a constitution is <i>amended</i> by the people;
an ancient text is <i>emended</i> by a critic who believes that what
seems to him the better reading is what the author wrote. Compare

<p><i>Amiable</i> combines the senses of <i>lovable</i> or <i>lovely</i> and <i>loving</i>; the
<i>amiable</i> character has ready affection and kindliness for others,
with the qualities that are adapted to win their love; <i>amiable</i> is a
higher and stronger word than <i>good-natured</i> or <i>agreeable</i>. <i>Lovely</i>
is often applied to externals; as, a <i>lovely</i> face. <i>Amiable</i> denotes a
disposition desirous to cheer, please, and make happy. A selfish
man of the world may have the art to be <i>agreeable</i>; a handsome,
brilliant, and witty person may be <i>charming</i> or even <i>attractive</i>,
while by no means <i>amiable</i>. The <i>engaging</i>, <i>winning</i>, and <i>winsome</i>
add to amiability something of beauty, accomplishments,
and grace. The <i>benignant</i> are calmly kind, as from a height
and a distance. <i>Kind</i>, <i>good-natured</i> people may be coarse and
rude, and so fail to be <i>agreeable</i> or <i>pleasing</i>; the really <i>amiable</i>
are likely to avoid such faults by their earnest desire to please.
The <i>good-natured</i> have an easy disposition to get along comfortably
with every one in all circumstances. A <i>sweet</i> disposition is

of two persons or objects, or of two groups of persons or objects.
"Let there be no strife, I pray thee, <i>between</i> me and thee, and

wholly applied to discourse or writing, signifying to make fuller

as by stating fully what was before only implied, or by adding
illustrations to make the meaning more readily apprehended,
etc. The chief difficulty of very young writers is to <i>amplify</i>, to
get beyond the bare curt statement by <i>developing</i>, <i>expanding</i>, <i>unfolding</i>
the thought. The chief difficulty of those who have more
material and experience is to condense sufficiently. So, in the
early days of our literature <i>amplify</i> was used in the favorable
sense; but at present this word and most kindred words are coming
to share the derogatory meaning that has long attached to
<i>expatiate</i>. We may <i>develop</i> a thought, <i>expand</i> an illustration,

</table>

<p><i>Displeasure</i> is the mildest and most general word. <i>Choler</i> and
<i>ire</i>, now rare except in poetic or highly rhetorical language, denote
a still, and the latter a persistent, <i>anger</i>. <i>Temper</i> used alone in
the sense of <i>anger</i> is colloquial, tho we may correctly say a
hot <i>temper</i>, a fiery <i>temper</i>, etc. <i>Passion</i>, tho a word of far
wider application, may, in the singular, be employed to denote
<i>anger</i>; "did put me in a towering <i>passion</i>," <span class="smc">Shakespeare</span> <i>Hamlet</i>
act v, sc. 2. <i>Anger</i> is violent and vindictive emotion, which is
sharp, sudden, and, like all violent passions, necessarily brief.
<i>Resentment</i> (a feeling back or feeling over again) is persistent, the
bitter brooding over injuries. <i>Exasperation</i>, a roughening, is a
hot, superficial intensity of <i>anger</i>, demanding instant expression.
<i>Rage</i> drives one beyond the bounds of prudence or discretion; <i>fury</i>
is stronger yet, and sweeps one away into uncontrollable violence.
<i>Anger</i> is personal and usually selfish, aroused by real or supposed
wrong to oneself, and directed specifically and intensely against
the person who is viewed as blameworthy. <i>Indignation</i> is impersonal
and unselfish <i>displeasure</i> at unworthy acts (L. <i>indigna</i>), <i>i. e.</i>,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
at wrong as wrong. Pure <i>indignation</i> is not followed by regret,
and needs no repentance; it is also more self-controlled than
<i>anger</i>. <i>Anger</i> is commonly a sin; <i>indignation</i> is often a duty.
<i>Wrath</i> is deep and perhaps vengeful <i>displeasure</i>, as when the people
of Nazareth were "filled with <i>wrath</i>" at the plain words of
Jesus (<i>Luke</i> iv, 28); it may, however, simply express the culmination
of righteous <i>indignation</i> without malice in a pure being; as,
the <i>wrath</i> of God. <i>Impatience</i>, <i>fretfulness</i>, <i>irritation</i>, <i>peevishness</i>,
<i>pettishness</i>, <i>petulance</i>, and <i>vexation</i> express the slighter
forms of anger. <i>Irritation</i>, <i>petulance</i>, and <i>vexation</i> are temporary
and for immediate cause. <i>Fretfulness</i>, <i>pettishness</i>, and <i>peevishness</i>
are chronic states finding in any petty matter an occasion
for their exercise. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#ACRIMONY">ACRIMONY</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#ENMITY">ENMITY</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#HATRED">HATRED</a></span>.</p>

<tr><td>brute,</td><td>living creature,</td></tr>
</table>

<p>An <i>animal</i> is a <i>sentient being</i>, distinct from inanimate matter
and from vegetable life on the one side and from mental and spiritual
existence on the other. Thus man is properly classified as an
<i>animal</i>. But because the animal life is the lowest and rudest part
of his being and that which he shares with inferior <i>creatures</i>, to
call any individual man an <i>animal</i> is to imply that the animal
nature has undue supremacy, and so is deep condemnation or utter
insult. The <i>brute</i> is the <i>animal</i> viewed as dull to all finer feeling;
the <i>beast</i> is looked upon as a being of appetites. To call
a man a <i>brute</i> is to imply that he is unfeeling and cruel; to call
him a <i>beast</i> is to indicate that he is vilely sensual. We speak of
the cruel father as a <i>brute</i> to his children; of the drunkard as
making a <i>beast</i> of himself. So firmly are these figurative senses
established that we now incline to avoid applying <i>brute</i> or <i>beast</i>
to any creature, as a horse or dog, for which we have any affection;
we prefer in such cases the word <i>animal</i>. <i>Creature</i> is a
word of wide signification, including all the things that God<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
has created, whether inanimate objects, plants, animals, angels,
or men. The <i>animals</i> of a region are collectively called its <i>fauna</i>.</p>

We <i>advertise</i> our business, <i>communicate</i> our intentions, <i>enunciate</i>
our views; we <i>notify</i> an individual, <i>give notice</i> to the public. <i>Declare</i>
has often an authoritative force; to <i>declare</i> war is to cause
war to be, where before there may have been only hostilities; we
say <i>declare</i> war, <i>proclaim</i> peace. We <i>propound</i> a question or an

<h3>ANSWER.</h3>

<h4>Synonyms:</h4>

<table class="tbs" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>rejoinder,</td><td>repartee,</td><td>reply,</td><td>response,</td><td>retort.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A verbal <i>answer</i> is a return of words to something that seems
to call for them, and is made to a charge as well as to a question;
an <i>answer</i> may be even made to an unspoken implication or manifestation;
see <i>Luke</i> v, 22. In a wider sense, anything said or
done in return for some word, action, or suggestion of another
may be called an <i>answer</i>. The blow of an enraged man, the
whinny of a horse, the howling of the wind, the movement of a
bolt in a lock, an echo, etc., may each be an <i>answer</i> to some word<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
or movement. A <i>reply</i> is an unfolding, and ordinarily implies
thought and intelligence. A <i>rejoinder</i> is strictly an <i>answer</i> to a
<i>reply</i>, tho often used in the general sense of <i>answer</i>, but always
with the implication of something more or less controversial or
opposed, tho lacking the conclusiveness implied in <i>answer</i>;
an <i>answer</i>, in the full sense, to a charge, an argument, or an
objection is adequate, and finally refutes and disposes of it; a <i>reply</i>
or <i>rejoinder</i> may be quite inadequate, so that one may say, "This
<i>reply</i> is not an <i>answer</i>;" "I am ready with an <i>answer</i>" means
far more than "I am ready with a <i>reply</i>." A <i>response</i> is accordant
or harmonious, designed or adapted to carry on the thought
of the words that called it forth, as the <i>responses</i> in a liturgical
service, or to meet the wish of him who seeks it; as, the appeal
for aid met a prompt and hearty <i>response</i>. <i>Repartee</i> is a prompt,
witty, and commonly good-natured <i>answer</i> to some argument or
attack; a <i>retort</i> may also be witty, but is severe and may be even
savage in its intensity.</p>

<p>To <i>anticipate</i> may be either to take before in fact or to take
before in thought; in the former sense it is allied with <i>prevent</i>; in
the latter, with the synonyms above given. This is coming to be
the prevalent and favorite use. We <i>expect</i> that which we have
good reason to believe will happen; as, a boy <i>expects</i> to grow to
manhood. We <i>hope</i> for that which we much desire and somewhat
<i>expect</i>. We <i>apprehend</i> what we both <i>expect</i> and fear. <i>Anticipate</i>
is commonly used now, like <i>foretaste</i>, of that which we
<i>expect</i> both with confidence and pleasure. In this use it is a
stronger word than <i>hope</i>, where often "the wish is father to the
thought." I <i>hope</i> for a visit from my friend, tho I have no
word from him; I <i>expect</i> it when he writes that he is coming;
and as the time draws near I <i>anticipate</i> it with pleasure. Compare

<p><i>Antique</i> refers to an <i>ancient</i>, <i>antiquated</i> to a discarded style.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
<i>Antique</i> is that which is either <i>ancient</i> in fact or <i>ancient</i> in style.
The reference is to the style rather than to the age. We can speak
of the <i>antique</i> architecture of a church just built. The difference
between <i>antiquated</i> and <i>antique</i> is not in the age, for a Puritan
style may be scorned as <i>antiquated</i>, while a Roman or Renaissance
style may be prized as <i>antique</i>. The <i>antiquated</i> is not so
much out of date as out of vogue. <i>Old-fashioned</i> may be used
approvingly or contemptuously. In the latter case it becomes a
synonym for <i>antiquated</i>; in the good sense it approaches the
meaning of <i>antique</i>, but indicates less duration. We call a wide
New England fireplace <i>old-fashioned</i>; a coin of the C&aelig;sars, <i>antique</i>.
<i>Quaint</i> combines the idea of age with a pleasing oddity; as,
a <i>quaint</i> gambrel-roofed house. <i>Antiquated</i> is sometimes used
of persons in a sense akin to <i>superannuated</i>. The <i>antiquated</i> person
is out of style and out of sympathy with the present generation
by reason of age; the <i>superannuated</i> person is incapacitated
for present activities by reason of age. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#OLD">OLD</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Anxiety</i> is, according to its derivation, a choking <i>disquiet</i>, akin
to <i>anguish</i>; <i>anxiety</i> is mental; <i>anguish</i> may be mental or physical;
<i>anguish</i> is in regard to the known, <i>anxiety</i> in regard to the
unknown; <i>anguish</i> is because of what has happened, <i>anxiety</i> because
of what may happen. <i>Anxiety</i> refers to some future event,
always suggesting hopeful possibility, and thus differing from
<i>apprehension</i>, <i>fear</i>, <i>dread</i>, <i>foreboding</i>, <i>terror</i>, all of which may
be quite despairing. In matters within our reach, <i>anxiety</i> always
stirs the question whether something can not be done, and is thus
a valuable spur to doing; in this respect it is allied to <i>care</i>. <i>Foreboding</i>,
<i>dread</i>, etc., commonly incapacitate for all helpful thought
or endeavor. <i>Worry</i> is a more petty, restless, and manifest
<i>anxiety</i>; <i>anxiety</i> may be quiet and silent; <i>worry</i> is communicated
to all around. <i>Solicitude</i> is a milder <i>anxiety</i>. <i>Fretting</i> or <i>fretfulness</i>
is a weak complaining without thought of accomplishing or
changing anything, but merely as a relief to one's own <i>disquiet</i>.
<i>Perplexity</i> often involves <i>anxiety</i>, but may be quite free from it.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>

</table>

<p><i>Apathy</i>, according to its Greek derivation, is a simple absence
of feeling or emotion. There are persons to whom a certain
degree of <i>apathy</i> is natural, an innate <i>sluggishness</i> of the emotional
nature. In the <i>apathy</i> of despair, a person gives up, without
resistance or sensibility, to what he has fiercely struggled to avoid.
While <i>apathy</i> is want of feeling, <i>calmness</i> is feeling without agitation.
<i>Calmness</i> is the result of strength, courage, or trust; <i>apathy</i>
is the result of dulness or weakness. <i>Composure</i> is freedom from
agitation or disturbance, resulting ordinarily from force of will,
or from perfect confidence in one's own resources. <i>Impassibility</i>
is a philosophical term applied to the Deity, as infinitely exalted
above all stir of passion or emotion. <i>Unfeelingness</i>, the Saxon word
that should be the exact equivalent of <i>apathy</i>, really means more,
a lack of the feeling one ought to have, a censurable hardness of
heart. <i>Indifference</i> and <i>insensibility</i> designate the absence of feeling
toward certain persons or things; <i>apathy</i>, entire absence of feeling.
<i>Indifference</i> is a want of interest; <i>insensibility</i> is a want of
feeling; <i>unconcern</i> has reference to consequences. We speak of
<i>insensibility</i> of heart, <i>immobility</i> of countenance. <i>Stoicism</i> is an
intentional suppression of feeling and deadening of sensibilities,
while <i>apathy</i> is involuntary. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#CALM">CALM</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#REST">REST</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#STUPOR">STUPOR</a></span>.</p>

<p>There is no discernible difference in sense between so much

is generally used of numbers and abstract relations. <i>Individually</i>
emphasizes the independence of the individuals; <i>separately</i> and
<i>severally</i> still more emphatically hold them apart. The signers of
a note may become jointly and <i>severally</i> responsible, that is, <i>each</i>
liable for the entire amount, as if he had signed it alone. Witnesses
are often brought <i>separately</i> into court, in order that no

<p>All these words express one's answer to a charge of wrong or
error that is or might be made. <i>Apology</i> has undergone a remarkable
change from its old sense of a valiant <i>defense</i>&mdash;as in
Justin Martyr's <i>Apologies</i> for the Christian faith&mdash;to its present
meaning of humble <i>confession</i> and concession. He who offers an
<i>apology</i> admits himself, at least technically and seemingly, in the
wrong. An <i>apology</i> is for what one has done or left undone;
an <i>excuse</i> may be for what one proposes to do or leave undone
as well; as, one sends beforehand his <i>excuse</i> for not accepting
an invitation; if he should fail either to be present or to excuse
himself, an <i>apology</i> would be in order. An <i>excuse</i> for a fault is
an attempt at partial justification; as, one alleges haste as an <i>excuse</i>
for carelessness. <i>Confession</i> is a full <i>acknowledgment</i> of
wrong, generally of a grave wrong, with or without <i>apology</i> or
<i>excuse</i>. <i>Plea</i> ranges in sense from a prayer for favor or pardon
to an attempt at full <i>vindication</i>. <i>Defense</i>, <i>exculpation</i>, <i>justification</i>,
and <i>vindication</i> are more properly antonyms than synonyms
of <i>apology</i> in its modern sense, and should be so given, but for<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>

<p>The <i>apparent</i> is that which appears; the word has two contrasted
senses, either of that which is manifest, visible, certain,
or of that which merely seems to be and may be very different
from what is; as, the <i>apparent</i> motion of the sun around the
earth. <i>Apparent</i> kindness casts a doubt on the reality of the
kindness; <i>apparent</i> neglect implies that more care and pains may
have been bestowed than we are aware of. <i>Presumable</i> implies
that a thing may be reasonably supposed beforehand without any
full knowledge of the facts. <i>Probable</i> implies that we know facts
enough to make us moderately confident of it. <i>Seeming</i> expresses
great doubt of the reality; <i>seeming</i> innocence comes very near in
meaning to <i>probable</i> guilt. <i>Apparent</i> indicates less assurance
than <i>probable</i>, and more than <i>seeming</i>. A man's <i>probable</i> intent
we believe will prove to be his real intent; his <i>seeming</i> intent we
believe to be a sham; his <i>apparent</i> intent may be the true one,
tho we have not yet evidence on which to pronounce with certainty
or even with confidence. <i>Likely</i> is a word with a wide
range of usage, but always implying the belief that the thing is, or

<p>An <i>adjunct</i> (something joined to) constitutes no real part of the
thing or system to which it is joined, tho perhaps a valuable
<i>addition</i>; an <i>appendage</i> is commonly a real, tho not an essential
or necessary part of that with which it is connected; an
<i>appurtenance</i> belongs subordinately to something by which it is
employed, especially as an instrument to accomplish some purpose.
A horse's tail is at once an ornamental <i>appendage</i> and a
useful <i>appurtenance</i>; we could not call it an <i>adjunct</i>, tho we
might use that word of his iron shoes. An <i>attachment</i> in machinery
is some mechanism that can be brought into optional connection
with the principal movement; a hemmer is a valuable <i>attachment</i>
of a sewing-machine. An <i>extension</i>, as of a railroad or of
a franchise, carries out further something already existing. We
add an <i>appendix</i> to a book, to contain names, dates, lists, etc.,
which would encumber the text; we add a <i>supplement</i> to supply
omissions, as, for instance, to bring it up to date. An <i>appendix</i>
may be called an <i>addendum</i>; but <i>addendum</i> may be used of a
brief note, which would not be dignified by the name of <i>appendix</i>;
such notes are often grouped as <i>addenda</i>. An <i>addition</i> might
be matter interwoven in the body of the work, an index, plates,
editorial notes, etc., which might be valuable <i>additions</i>, but not<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>

<p><i>Appetite</i> is used only of the demands of the physical system,
unless otherwise expressly stated, as when we say an <i>appetite</i> for
knowledge; <i>passion</i> includes all excitable impulses of our nature,
as anger, fear, love, hatred, etc. <i>Appetite</i> is thus more animal
than <i>passion</i>; and when we speak of <i>passions</i> and <i>appetites</i> as
conjoined or contrasted, we think of the <i>appetites</i> as wholly physical

<p>To <i>allot</i> or <i>assign</i> may be to make an arbitrary division; the

is given by some fixed rule, which is meant to be uniform and
fair; as, representatives are <i>apportioned</i> among the States according
to population. To <i>dispense</i> is to give out freely; as, the sun
<i>dispenses</i> light and heat. A thing is <i>appropriated</i> to or for a specific
purpose (to which it thus becomes <i>proper</i>, in the original
sense of being its own); money <i>appropriated</i> by Congress for one
purpose can not be expended for any other. One may <i>apportion</i>

<tr><td>contiguity,</td><td>nearness,</td><td>propinquity,</td><td>similarity.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In mathematics, <i>approximation</i> is not guesswork, not looseness,
and not error. The process of <i>approximation</i> is as exact and
correct at every point as that by which an absolute result is secured;
the result only fails of exactness because of some inherent
difficulty in the problem. The attempt to "square the circle"
gives only an <i>approximate</i> result, because of the impossibility of
expressing the circumference in terms of the radius. But the
limits of error on either side are known, and the <i>approximation</i>
has practical value. Outside of mathematics, the correct use of
<i>approximation</i> (and the kindred words <i>approximate</i> and <i>approximately</i>)
is to express as near an approach to accuracy and certainty
as the conditions of human thought or action in any given case
make possible. <i>Resemblance</i> and <i>similarity</i> may be but superficial
and apparent; <i>approximation</i> is real. <i>Approach</i> is a relative
term, indicating that one has come nearer than before, tho the
distance may yet be considerable; an <i>approximation</i> brings one
really near. <i>Nearness</i>, <i>neighborhood</i>, and <i>propinquity</i> are commonly
used of place; <i>approximation</i>, of mathematical calculations
and abstract reasoning; we speak of <i>approach</i> to the shore, <i>nearness</i>
to the town, <i>approximation</i> to the truth.</p>

disuse of defensive <i>armor</i> the word has practically gone out of
military use, but it is still employed in the navy, where the distinction<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
is clearly preserved; any vessel provided with cannon is
an <i>armed</i> vessel; an <i>armored</i> ship is an ironclad. Anything that

</table>

<p>An <i>army</i> is an organized body of men armed for war, ordinarily
considerable in numbers, always independent in organization
so far as not to be a constituent part of any other command. Organization,
unity, and independence, rather than numbers are the
essentials of an <i>army</i>. We speak of the invading <i>army</i> of Cortes or
Pizarro, tho either body was contemptible in numbers from a modern
military standpoint. We may have a little <i>army</i>, a large <i>army</i>,
or a vast <i>army</i>. <i>Host</i> is used for any vast and orderly assemblage;
as, the stars are called the heavenly <i>host</i>. <i>Multitude</i> expresses
number without order or organization; a <i>multitude</i> of
armed men is not an <i>army</i>, but a mob. <i>Legion</i> (from the Latin)
and <i>phalanx</i> (from the Greek) are applied by a kind of poetic
license to modern <i>forces</i>; the plural <i>legions</i> is preferred to the
singular. <i>Military</i> is a general word for land-<i>forces</i>; the <i>military</i>
may include all the armed <i>soldiery</i> of a nation, or the term may
be applied to any small detached company, as at a fort, in distinction
from civilians. Any organized body of men by whom the
law or will of a people is executed is a <i>force</i>; the word is a usual
term for the police of any locality.</p>

<tr><td>accuse,</td><td>charge,</td><td>impeach,</td><td>prosecute,</td></tr>
<tr><td>censure,</td><td>cite,</td><td>indict,</td><td>summon.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Arraign</i> is an official word; a person accused of crime is
<i>arraigned</i> when he is formally called into court, the indictment
read to him, and the demand made of him to plead guilty or not
guilty; in more extended use, to <i>arraign</i> is to call in question for
fault in any formal, public, or official way. One may <i>charge</i>
another with any fault, great or trifling, privately or publicly,
formally or informally. <i>Accuse</i> is stronger than <i>charge</i>, suggesting
more of the formal and criminal; a person may <i>charge</i> a<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
friend with unkindness or neglect; he may <i>accuse</i> a tramp of
stealing. <i>Censure</i> carries the idea of fault, but not of crime; it
may be private and individual, or public and official. A judge, a
president, or other officer of high rank may be <i>impeached</i> before
the appropriate tribunal for high crimes; the veracity of a witness
may be <i>impeached</i> by damaging evidence. A person of the highest
character may be <i>summoned</i> as defendant in a civil suit; or he
may be <i>cited</i> to answer as administrator, etc. <i>Indict</i> and <i>arraign</i>
apply strictly to criminal proceedings, and only an alleged criminal
is <i>indicted</i> or <i>arraigned</i>. One is <i>indicted</i> by the grand jury,
and <i>arraigned</i> before the appropriate court.</p>

</table>

<p>The phrase <i>battle array</i> or <i>array of battle</i> is archaic and poetic;
we now say in <i>line</i> or <i>order of battle</i>. The <i>parade</i> is for <i>exhibition</i>
and oversight, and partial rehearsal of military manual and
maneuvers. <i>Array</i> refers to a continuous <i>arrangement</i> of men,
so that all may be seen or reviewed at once. This is practically
impossible with the vast <i>armies</i> of our day. We say rather the
<i>disposition</i> of troops, which expresses their location so as to sustain

</table>

<p>The legal term <i>arrest</i> carries always the implication of a legal
offense; this is true even of <i>arresting</i> for debt. But one may be
<i>detained</i> by process of law when no offense is alleged against him,
as in the case of a witness who is <i>held</i> in a house of detention till
a case comes to trial. One may be <i>restrained</i> of his liberty without
arrest, as in an insane asylum; an individual or corporation<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
may be <i>restrained</i> by injunction from selling certain property.
In case of an arrest, an officer may <i>secure</i> his prisoner by fetters,
by a locked door, or other means effectually to prevent escape.
<i>Capture</i> is commonly used of seizure by armed force; as, to <i>capture</i>

<p>A <i>contrivance</i> or <i>device</i> may be either good or bad. A <i>cheat</i>
is a mean advantage in a bargain; a <i>fraud</i>, any form of covert
robbery or injury. <i>Imposture</i> is a deceitful <i>contrivance</i> for securing
charity, credit, or consideration. A <i>stratagem</i> or <i>maneuver</i>
may be of the good against the bad, as it were a skilful movement
of war. A <i>wile</i> is usually but not necessarily evil.</p>

meaning. A <i>ruse</i> or a <i>blind</i> may be quite innocent and harmless.
An <i>artifice</i> is a carefully and delicately prepared <i>contrivance</i> for
doing indirectly what one could not well do directly. A <i>device</i> is
something studied out for promoting an end, as in a mechanism;
the word is used of indirect action, often, but not necessarily
directed to an evil, selfish, or injurious end. <i>Finesse</i> is especially
subtle <i>contrivance</i>, delicate <i>artifice</i>, whether for good or evil.

<p><i>Artist</i>, <i>artificer</i> and <i>artisan</i> are all from the root of <i>art</i>, but <i>artist</i>
holds to the esthetic sense, while <i>artificer</i> and <i>artisan</i> follow the
mechanical or industrial sense of the word (see <span class="smcl">ART</span> under <span class="smcl"><a href="#SCIENCE">SCIENCE</a></span>).<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
<i>Artist</i> thus comes only into accidental association with the other
words of this group, not being a synonym of any one of them and
having practically no synonym of its own. The work of the <i>artist</i>
is creative; that of the <i>artisan</i> mechanical. The man who paints
a beautiful picture is an <i>artist</i>; the man who makes pin-heads
all day is an <i>artisan</i>. The <i>artificer</i> is between the two, putting
more thought, intelligence, and taste into his work than the <i>artisan</i>,
but less of the idealizing, creative power than the <i>artist</i>. The
sculptor, shaping his model in clay, is <i>artificer</i>, as well as <i>artist</i>;
patient <i>artisans</i>, working simply by rule and scale, chisel and polish
the stone. The man who constructs anything by mere routine
and rule is a <i>mechanic</i>. The man whose work involves thought,
skill, and constructive power is an <i>artificer</i>. The hod-carrier is a
<i>laborer</i>; the bricklayer is a <i>mechanic</i>; the master mason is an <i>artificer</i>.
Those who operate machinery nearly self-acting are <i>operatives</i>.</p>

expect; "if a son shall <i>ask</i> bread of any of you that is a father,"
<i>Luke</i> xi, 11; he <i>begs</i> for that to which he advances no claim but
pity. <i>Demand</i> is a determined and often an arrogant word; one
may rightfully <i>demand</i> what is his own or his due, when it is
withheld or denied; or he may wrongfully <i>demand</i> that to which
he has no claim but power. <i>Require</i> is less arrogant and obtrusive
than <i>demand</i>, but is exceedingly strenuous; as, the court <i>requires</i>
the attendance of witnesses. <i>Entreat</i> implies a special
earnestness of asking, and <i>beseech</i>, a still added and more humble
intensity; <i>beseech</i> was formerly often used as a polite intensive for
<i>beg</i> or <i>pray</i>; as, I <i>beseech</i> you to tell me. To <i>implore</i> is to <i>ask</i>
with weeping and lamentation; to <i>supplicate</i> is to <i>ask</i>, as it were,

<i>crave</i> has almost disappeared from conversation; <i>request</i> would

that is his right; if he <i>assumes</i> what does not belong to him, he is

<p><i>Acute</i>, from the Latin, suggests the sharpness of the needle's
point; <i>keen</i>, from the Saxon, the sharpness of the cutting edge.
<i>Astute</i>, from the Latin, with the original sense of <i>cunning</i> has
come to have a meaning that combines the sense of <i>acute</i> or <i>keen</i>
with that of <i>sagacious</i>. The <i>astute</i> mind adds to <i>acuteness</i> and
<i>keenness</i> an element of cunning or finesse. The <i>astute</i> debater
leads his opponents into a snare by getting them to make admissions,
or urge arguments, of which he sees a result that they do
not perceive. The <i>acute</i>, <i>keen</i> intellect may take no special advantage
of these qualities; the <i>astute</i> mind has always a point to
make for itself, and seldom fails to make it. A <i>knowing</i> look,
air, etc., in general indicates practical knowledge with a touch of
shrewdness, and perhaps of cunning; in regard to some special
matter, it indicates the possession of reserved knowledge which
the person could impart if he chose. <i>Knowing</i> has often a slightly
invidious sense. We speak of a <i>knowing</i> rascal, meaning <i>cunning</i>
or <i>shrewd</i> within a narrow range, but of a <i>knowing</i> horse or dog,
in the sense of <i>sagacious</i>, implying that he knows more than
could be expected of such an animal. A <i>knowing</i> child has more
knowledge than would be looked for at his years, perhaps more
than is quite desirable, while to speak of a child as <i>intelligent</i> is
altogether complimentary.</p>

One may <i>assail</i> another with reproaches; he <i>assaults</i> him with a
blow, a brandished weapon, etc. Armies or squadrons <i>charge</i>;
<i>combat</i> and <i>encounter</i> may be said of individual contests. To

<p>A <i>quality</i> (L. <i>qualis</i>, such)&mdash;the "suchness" of anything, according
to the German idiom&mdash;denotes what a thing really is in
some one respect; an <i>attribute</i> is what we conceive a thing to be in
some one respect; thus, while <i>attribute</i> may, <i>quality</i> must, express
something of the real nature of that to which it is ascribed;
we speak of the <i>attributes</i> of God, the <i>qualities</i> of matter. "Originally
'the <i>attributes</i> of God' was preferred, probably, because
men assumed no knowledge of the actual <i>qualities</i> of the Deity,
but only of those more or less fitly attributed to him." J. A. H.
<span class="smc">Murray</span>. [<span class="smcl">M.</span>] Holiness is an <i>attribute</i> of God; the <i>attributes</i> of
many heathen deities have been only the <i>qualities</i> of wicked men
joined to superhuman power. A <i>property</i> (L. <i>proprius</i>, one's
own) is what belongs especially to one thing as its own peculiar
possession, in distinction from all other things; when we speak of
the <i>qualities</i> or the <i>properties</i> of matter, <i>quality</i> is the more general,
<i>property</i> the more limited term. A <i>quality</i> is inherent; a
<i>property</i> may be transient; physicists now, however, prefer to
term those <i>qualities</i> manifested by all bodies (such as impenetrability,
extension, etc.), <i>general properties</i> of matter, while those
peculiar to certain substances or to certain states of those substances
(as fluidity, malleability, etc.) are termed <i>specific properties</i>;

he gives his assurance as the voucher for what he <i>avouches</i>;
he <i>avows</i> openly a belief or intention that he has silently held.
<i>Avow</i> and <i>avouch</i> take a direct object; <i>aver</i> is followed by a conjunction:

was present. <i>Avow</i> has usually a good sense; what a person
<i>avows</i> he at least does not treat as blameworthy, criminal, or
shameful; if he did, he would be said to <i>confess</i> it; yet there is
always the suggestion that some will be ready to challenge or censure

<p><i>Awkward</i>, from <i>awk</i> (kindred with <i>off</i>, from the Norwegian),
is <i>off-ward</i>, turned the wrong way; it was anciently used of a
back-handed or left-handed blow in battle, of squinting eyes, etc.
<i>Clumsy</i>, on the other hand (from <i>clumse</i>, also through the Norwegian),
signifies benumbed, stiffened with cold; this is the original
meaning of <i>clumsy</i> fingers, <i>clumsy</i> limbs. Thus, <i>awkward</i> primarily
refers to action, <i>clumsy</i> to condition. A tool, a vehicle, or
the human frame may be <i>clumsy</i> in shape or build, <i>awkward</i> in
motion. The <i>clumsy</i> man is almost of necessity <i>awkward</i>, but
the <i>awkward</i> man may not be naturally <i>clumsy</i>. The finest untrained
colt is <i>awkward</i> in harness; a horse that is <i>clumsy</i> in build
can never be trained out of awkwardness. An <i>awkward</i> statement
has an uncomfortable, and perhaps recoiling force; a statement
that contains ill-assorted and incongruous material in ill-chosen
language is <i>clumsy</i>. We speak of an <i>awkward</i> predicament,
an <i>awkward</i> scrape. An <i>awkward</i> excuse commonly reflects
on the one who offers it. We say the admitted facts have an<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
<i>awkward</i> appearance. In none of these cases could <i>clumsy</i> be
used. <i>Clumsy</i> is, however, applied to movements that seem as
unsuitable as those of benumbed and stiffened limbs. A dancing
bear is both <i>clumsy</i> and <i>awkward</i>.</p>

</table>

<p>Both the <i>axiom</i> and the <i>truism</i> are instantly seen to be true,
and need no proof; but in an <i>axiom</i> there is progress of thought,
while the <i>truism</i> simply says the same thing over again, or says
what is too manifest to need saying. The <i>axiom</i> that "things
which are equal to the same thing are equal to one another"
unfolds in the latter part of the sentence the truth implied in the
first part, which might have been overlooked if not stated. In the
<i>truism</i> that "a man can do all he is capable of," the former and
the latter part of the sentence are simply identical, and the mind
is left just where it started. Hence the <i>axiom</i> is valuable and
useful, while the <i>truism</i> is weak and flat, unless the form of statement
makes it striking or racy, as "all fools are out of their wits."

<p>Most of these words are onomatopoetic. The <i>cackle</i> of a hen,
the <i>gabble</i> of a goose, the <i>chatter</i> of a magpie, the <i>babble</i> of a
running stream, as applied to human speech, indicate a rapid succession
of what are to the listener meaningless sounds. <i>Blab</i> and
<i>blurt</i> (commonly <i>blurt out</i>) refer to the letting out of what the
lips can no longer keep in; <i>blab</i>, of a secret; <i>blurt out</i>, of passionate
feeling. To <i>chat</i> is to talk in an easy, pleasant way, not
without sense, but without special purpose. <i>Chatting</i> is the practise
of adults, <i>prattling</i> that of children. To <i>prate</i> is to talk idly,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
presumptuously, or foolishly, but not necessarily incoherently.
To <i>jabber</i> is to utter a rapid succession of unintelligible sounds,

personal matters, as for pastime or mischief. To <i>twaddle</i> is to
talk feeble nonsense. To <i>murmur</i> is to utter suppressed or even

<p><i>Bank</i> is a general term for the land along the edge of a water
course; it may also denote a raised portion of the bed of a river,
lake, or ocean; as, the <i>Banks</i> of Newfoundland. A <i>beach</i> is a
strip or expanse of incoherent wave-worn sand, which is often
pebbly or full of boulders; we speak of the <i>beach</i> of a lake or
ocean; a <i>beach</i> is sometimes found in the bend of a river. <i>Strand</i>

<p><i>Banter</i> is the touching upon some fault, weakness, or fancied
secret of another in a way half to pique and half to please; <i>badinage</i>
is delicate, refined <i>banter</i>. <i>Raillery</i> has more sharpness,
but is usually good-humored and well meant. <i>Irony</i>, the saying
one thing that the reverse may be understood, may be either mild
or bitter. All the other words have a hostile intent. <i>Ridicule</i>
makes a person or thing the subject of contemptuous merriment;
<i>derision</i> seeks to make the object derided seem utterly despicable&mdash;to
laugh it to scorn. <i>Chaff</i> is the coarse witticism of the streets,
perhaps merry, oftener malicious; <i>jeering</i> is loud, rude <i>ridicule</i>,
as of a hostile crowd or mob. <i>Mockery</i> is more studied, and may
include mimicry and personal violence, as well as scornful speech.
A <i>satire</i> is a formal composition; a <i>sarcasm</i> may be an impromptu
sentence. The <i>satire</i> shows up follies to keep people from them;
the <i>sarcasm</i> hits them because they are foolish, without inquiring
whether it will do good or harm; the <i>satire</i> is plainly uttered; the

<p>A <i>bar</i> is something that is or may be firmly fixed, ordinarily

than those to which <i>bar</i> is ordinarily applied. A mountain range
may be a <i>barrier</i> to exploration; but a mass of sand across the
entrance to a harbor is called a <i>bar</i>. Discovered falsehood is a
<i>bar</i> to confidence. <i>Barricade</i> has become practically a technical
name for an improvised street fortification, and, unless in some
way modified, is usually so understood. A <i>parapet</i> is a low or
breast-high wall, as about the edge of a roof, terrace, etc., especially,
in military use, such a wall for the protection of troops; a

<p><i>Conflict</i> is a general word which describes opponents, whether

between entire armies is a <i>battle</i>. Another <i>battle</i> may be fought
upon the same field after a considerable interval; or a new <i>battle</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>

An <i>action</i> is brief and partial; a <i>battle</i> may last for days. <i>Engagement</i>
is a somewhat formal expression for <i>battle</i>; as, it was

war, including many <i>battles</i>, may be a stubborn <i>contest</i>.
<i>Combat</i>, originally a hostile <i>encounter</i> between individuals, is

<tr><td>bonny,</td><td>elegant,</td><td>graceful,</td><td>pretty.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The definition of beauty, "perfection of form," is a good key
to the meaning of <i>beautiful</i>, if we understand "form" in its widest
sense. There must also be harmony and unity, and in human beings
spiritual loveliness, to constitute an object or a person really
<i>beautiful</i>. Thus, we speak of a <i>beautiful</i> landscape, a <i>beautiful</i>
poem. But <i>beautiful</i> implies also, in concrete objects, softness of
outline and delicacy of mold; it is opposed to all that is hard and
rugged, hence we say a <i>beautiful</i> woman, but not a <i>beautiful</i> man.
<i>Beautiful</i> has the further limit of not transcending our powers of
appreciation. <i>Pretty</i> expresses in a far less degree that which is
pleasing to a refined taste in objects comparatively small, slight,
and dainty; as, a <i>pretty</i> bonnet; a <i>pretty</i> girl. That is <i>handsome</i>
which is not only superficially pleasing, but well and harmoniously
proportioned, with usually the added idea that it is made so by
art, breeding, or training; as, a <i>handsome</i> horse; a <i>handsome</i>
house. <i>Handsome</i> is a term far inferior to <i>beautiful</i>; we may
even say a <i>handsome</i> villain. <i>Fair</i> denotes what is bright, smooth,
clear, and without blemish; as, a <i>fair</i> face. The word applies
wholly to what is superficial; we can say "<i>fair</i>, yet false." In a
specific sense, <i>fair</i> has the sense of blond, as opposed to dark or brunette.
One who possesses vivacity, wit, good nature, or other
pleasing qualities may be <i>attractive</i> without beauty. <i>Comely</i> denotes
an aspect that is smooth, genial, and wholesome, with a certain
fulness of contour and pleasing symmetry, tho falling<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
short of the <i>beautiful</i>; as, a <i>comely</i> matron. That is <i>picturesque</i>

<p><i>Because</i>, literally <i>by</i>-cause, is the most direct and complete
word for giving the reason of a thing. <i>Since</i>, originally denoting
succession in time, signifies a succession in a chain of reasoning, a

parallel. <i>Since</i> is weaker than <i>because</i>; <i>as</i> is weaker than
<i>since</i>; either may introduce the reason before the main statement;
thus, <i>since</i> or <i>as</i> you are going, I will accompany you.
Often the weaker word is the more courteous, implying less constraint;
for example, <i>as</i> you request it, I will come, rather than I
will come <i>because</i> you request it. <i>Inasmuch as</i> is a formal and
qualified expression, implying by just so much, and no more;
thus, <i>inasmuch as</i> the debtor has no property, I abandon the
claim. <i>For</i> is a loose connective, giving often mere suggestion or

<p>The Latin <i>commencement</i> is more formal than the Saxon <i>beginning</i>,

is for the most part restricted to some form of action,
while <i>beginning</i> has no restriction, but may be applied to action,
state, material, extent, enumeration, or to whatever else may be
conceived of as having a first part, point, degree, etc. The letter
A is at the <i>beginning</i> (not the <i>commencement</i>) of every alphabet.
If we were to speak of the <i>commencement</i> of the Pacific Railroad,
we should be understood to refer to the enterprise and its initiatory
act; if we were to refer to the roadway we should say "Here is
the <i>beginning</i> of the Pacific Railroad." In the great majority of
cases <i>begin</i> and <i>beginning</i> are preferable to <i>commence</i> and <i>commencement</i>
as the simple, idiomatic English words, always accurate
and expressive. "In the <i>beginning</i> was the word," <i>John</i> i, 1. An
<i>origin</i> is the point from which something starts or sets out, often
involving, and always suggesting causal connection; as, the <i>origin</i>
of evil; the <i>origin</i> of a nation, a government, or a family. A
<i>source</i> is that which furnishes a first and continuous supply, that
which flows forth freely or may be readily recurred to; as, the
<i>source</i> of a river; a <i>source</i> of knowledge; a <i>source</i> of inspiration;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
fertile land is a <i>source</i> (not an <i>origin</i>) of wealth. A <i>rise</i> is thought
of as in an action; we say that a lake is the <i>source</i> of a certain
river, or that the river takes its <i>rise</i> from the lake. Motley wrote
of "The <i>Rise</i> of the Dutch Republic." <i>Fount</i>, <i>fountain</i>, and

<p>In some cases a thing is spoken of as <i>bent</i> where the parts
make an angle; but oftener to <i>bend</i> is understood to be to draw
to or through a curve; as, to <i>bend</i> a bow. To <i>submit</i> or <i>yield</i> is to
<i>bend</i> the mind humbly to another's wishes. To <i>incline</i> or <i>influence</i>
is to <i>bend</i> another's wishes toward our own; to <i>persuade</i> is to<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
draw them quite over. To <i>warp</i> is to <i>bend</i> silently through the
whole fiber, as a board in the sun. To <i>crook</i> is to <i>bend</i> irregularly,
as a <i>crooked</i> stick. <i>Deflect</i>, <i>deviate</i>, and <i>diverge</i> are said of
any turning away; <i>deviate</i> commonly of a slight and gradual
movement, <i>diverge</i> of a more sharp and decided one. To <i>bias</i> is
to cut across the texture, or incline to one side; in figurative use
always with an unfavorable import. <i>Mold</i> is a stronger work
than <i>bend</i>; we may <i>bend</i> by a superior force that which still resists
the constraint; as, a <i>bent</i> bow; we <i>mold</i> something plastic
entirely to some desired form.</p>

<h3><a name="BENEVOLENCE" id="BENEVOLENCE"></a>BENEVOLENCE.</h3>

<h4>Synonyms:</h4>

<table class="tbs" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<tr><td>beneficence,</td><td>generosity,</td><td>kindliness,</td><td>philanthropy,</td></tr>
<tr><td>benignity,</td><td>good-will,</td><td>kindness,</td><td>sympathy,</td></tr>
<tr><td>bounty,</td><td>humanity,</td><td>liberality,</td><td>unselfishness.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>According to the etymology and original usage, <i>beneficence</i> is
the doing well, <i>benevolence</i> the wishing or willing well to others;
but <i>benevolence</i> has come to include <i>beneficence</i>, and to displace
it. We should not now speak of <i>benevolence</i> which did not help,
unless where there was no power to help; even then we should
rather say <i>good-will</i> or <i>sympathy</i>. <i>Charity</i>, which originally
meant the purest love for God and man (as in <i>1 Cor.</i> xiii), is now
almost universally applied to some form of <i>almsgiving</i>, and is
much more limited in meaning than <i>benevolence</i>. <i>Benignity</i> suggests
some occult power of blessing, such as was formerly ascribed
to the stars; we may say a good man has an air of <i>benignity</i>.
<i>Kindness</i> and <i>tenderness</i> are personal; <i>benevolence</i> and <i>charity</i>
are general. <i>Kindness</i> extends to all sentient beings, whether men
or animals, in prosperity or in distress. <i>Tenderness</i> especially
goes out toward the young, feeble, and needy, or even to the dead.
<i>Humanity</i> is so much <i>kindness</i> and <i>tenderness</i> toward man or beast
as it would be inhuman not to have; we say of some act of care or
<i>kindness</i>, "common <i>humanity</i> requires it." <i>Generosity</i> is self-forgetful
<i>kindness</i> in disposition or action; it includes much besides
giving; as, the <i>generosity</i> of forgiveness. <i>Bounty</i> applies to
ample giving, which on a larger scale is expressed by <i>munificence</i>.
<i>Liberality</i> indicates broad, genial kindly views, whether manifested
in gifts or otherwise. We speak of the <i>bounty</i> of a generous
host, the <i>liberality</i> or <i>munificence</i> of the founder of a college,
or of the <i>liberality</i> of a theologian toward the holders of conflicting<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
beliefs. <i>Philanthropy</i> applies to wide schemes for human
welfare, often, but not always, involving large expenditures in
<i>charity</i> or <i>benevolence</i>. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#MERCY">MERCY</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Binding</i> is primarily by something flexible, as a cord or bandage
drawn closely around an object or group of objects, as when
we <i>bind</i> up a wounded limb. We <i>bind</i> a sheaf of wheat with a
cord; we <i>tie</i> the cord in a knot; we <i>fasten</i> by any means that
will make things hold together, as a board by nails, or a door by a
lock. The verbs <i>tie</i> and <i>fasten</i> are scarcely used in the figurative
sense, tho, using the noun, we speak of the <i>ties</i> of affection.
<i>Bind</i> has an extensive figurative use. One is <i>bound</i> by conscience
or honor; he is <i>obliged</i> by some imperious necessity; <i>engaged</i> by
his own promise; <i>compelled</i> by physical force or its moral equivalent.</p>

<tr><td>acidulated,</td><td>biting,</td><td>irate,</td><td>sour,</td><td>virulent.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Acid</i>, <i>sour</i>, and <i>bitter</i> agree in being contrasted with <i>sweet</i>, but<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
the two former are sharply distinguished from the latter. <i>Acid</i>
or <i>sour</i> is the taste of vinegar or lemon-juice; <i>bitter</i> that of quassia,
quinine, or strychnine. <i>Acrid</i> is nearly allied to <i>bitter</i>. <i>Pungent</i>
suggests the effect of pepper or snuff on the organs of taste
or smell; as, a <i>pungent</i> odor. <i>Caustic</i> indicates the corroding
effect of some strong chemical, as nitrate of silver. In a figurative
sense, as applied to language or character, these words are very
closely allied. We say a <i>sour</i> face, <i>sharp</i> words, <i>bitter</i> complaints,
<i>caustic</i> wit, <i>cutting</i> irony, <i>biting</i> sarcasm, a <i>stinging</i> taunt, <i>harsh</i>
judgment, a <i>tart</i> reply. <i>Harsh</i> carries the idea of intentional and
severe unkindness, <i>bitter</i> of a severity that arises from real or supposed
ill treatment. The <i>bitter</i> speech springs from the sore heart.
<i>Tart</i> and <i>sharp</i> utterances may not proceed from an intention to
wound, but merely from a wit recklessly keen; <i>cutting</i>, <i>stinging</i>,
and <i>biting</i> speech indicates more or less of hostile intent, the latter
being the more deeply malicious. The <i>caustic</i> utterance is meant
to burn, perhaps wholesomely, as in the satire of Juvenal or Cervantes.

<p>To <i>whiten</i> is to <i>make white</i> in general, but commonly it means
to overspread with white coloring-matter. <i>Bleach</i> and <i>blanch</i>
both signify to <i>whiten</i> by depriving of color, the former permanently,
as linen; the latter either permanently (as, to <i>blanch</i> celery)

<p>Whatever mars the beauty or completeness of an object is a
<i>blemish</i>, whether original, as squinting eyes, or the result of accident
or disease, etc., as the pits of smallpox. A <i>blemish</i> is superficial;
a <i>flaw</i> or <i>taint</i> is in structure or substance. In the moral<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
sense, we speak of a <i>blot</i> or <i>stain</i> upon reputation; a <i>flaw</i> or <i>taint</i>
in character. A <i>defect</i> is the want or lack of something; <i>fault</i>,
primarily a failing, is something that fails of an apparent intent
or disappoints a natural expectation; thus a sudden dislocation or
displacement of geological strata is called a <i>fault</i>. Figuratively,
a <i>blemish</i> comes from one's own ill-doing; a <i>brand</i> or <i>stigma</i> is
inflicted by others; as, the <i>brand</i> of infamy.</p>

<p>A <i>blow</i> is a sudden impact, as of a fist or a club; a <i>stroke</i> is a
sweeping movement; as, the <i>stroke</i> of a sword, of an oar, of the
arm in swimming. A <i>shock</i> is the sudden encounter with some
heavy body; as, colliding railway-trains meet with a <i>shock</i>; the
<i>shock</i> of battle. A <i>slap</i> is given with the open hand, a <i>lash</i> with
a whip, thong, or the like; we speak also of the <i>cut</i> of a whip. A
<i>buffet</i> or <i>cuff</i> is given only with the hand; a <i>blow</i> either with hand
or weapon. A <i>cuff</i> is a somewhat sidelong <i>blow</i>, generally with
the open hand; as, a <i>cuff</i> or <i>box</i> on the ear. A <i>stripe</i> is the effect
or mark of a <i>stroke</i>. In the metaphorical sense, <i>blow</i> is used for
sudden, stunning, staggering <i>calamity</i> or sorrow; <i>stroke</i> for
sweeping <i>disaster</i>, and also for sweeping achievement and success.
We say a <i>stroke</i> of paralysis, or a <i>stroke</i> of genius. We speak of
the <i>buffets</i> of adverse fortune. <i>Shock</i> is used of that which is at
once sudden, violent, and prostrating; we speak of a <i>shock</i> of
electricity, the <i>shock</i> of an amputation, a <i>shock</i> of surprise. Compare

<p><i>Body</i> denotes the entire physical structure, considered as a

its bony framework; <i>system</i> views it as an assemblage of many
related and harmonious organs. <i>Body</i>, <i>form</i>, <i>frame</i>, and <i>system</i>
may be either dead or living; <i>clay</i> and <i>dust</i> are sometimes so used
in religious or poetic style, tho ordinarily these words are used
only of the dead. <i>Corpse</i> and <i>remains</i> are used only of the dead.
<i>Corpse</i> is the plain technical word for a dead body still retaining
its unity; <i>remains</i> may be used after any lapse of time; the latter
is also the more refined and less ghastly term; as, friends are
invited to view the <i>remains</i>. <i>Carcass</i> applies only to the <i>body</i> of

<p>The <i>boundary</i> was originally the <i>landmark</i>, that which

<i>limit</i>, marked or unmarked. Now, however, the difference between
the two words has come to be simply one of usage. As
regards territory, we speak of the <i>boundaries</i> of a nation or of an
estate; the <i>bounds</i> of a college, a ball-ground, etc. <i>Bounds</i> may
be used for all within the <i>limits</i>, <i>boundary</i> for the limiting line
only. <i>Boundary</i> looks to that which is without; <i>bound</i> only to
that which is within. Hence we speak of the <i>bounds</i>, not the
<i>boundaries</i>, of a subject, of the universe, etc.; we say the students
were forbidden to go beyond the <i>bounds</i>. A <i>barrier</i> is something
that bars ingress or egress. A <i>barrier</i> may be a <i>boundary</i>,
as was the Great Wall of China. <i>Bourn</i>, or <i>bourne</i>, is a poetical
expression for <i>bound</i> or <i>boundary</i>. A <i>border</i> is a strip of land
along the <i>boundary</i>. <i>Edge</i> is a sharp terminal line, as where
river or ocean meets the land. <i>Limit</i> is now used almost wholly
in the figurative sense; as, the <i>limit</i> of discussion, of time, of
jurisdiction. <i>Line</i> is a military term; as, within the <i>lines</i>, or

</table>

<p>To <i>break</i> is to divide sharply, with severance of particles, as by
a blow or strain. To <i>burst</i> is to <i>break</i> by pressure from within, as a
bombshell, but it is used also for the result of violent force otherwise
exerted; as, to <i>burst</i> in a door, where the door yields as if
to an explosion. To <i>crush</i> is to <i>break</i> by pressure from without,
as an egg-shell. To <i>crack</i> is to <i>break</i> without complete severance
of parts; a <i>cracked</i> cup or mirror may still hold together. <i>Fracture</i>
has a somewhat similar sense. In a <i>fractured</i> limb, the ends
of the <i>broken</i> bone may be separated, tho both portions are
still retained within the common muscular tissue. A <i>shattered</i>
object is <i>broken</i> suddenly and in numerous directions; as, a vase
is <i>shattered</i> by a blow, a building by an earthquake. A <i>shivered</i>
glass is <i>broken</i> into numerous minute, needle-like fragments. To
<i>smash</i> is to <i>break</i> thoroughly to pieces with a crashing sound by
some sudden act of violence; a watch once <i>smashed</i> will scarcely
be worth repair. To <i>split</i> is to cause wood to crack or part in the
way of the grain, and is applied to any other case where a natural
tendency to separation is enforced by an external cause; as, to
<i>split</i> a convention or a party. To <i>demolish</i> is to beat down, as a
mound, building, fortress, etc.; to <i>destroy</i> is to put by any process
beyond restoration physically, mentally, or morally; to <i>destroy</i>
an army is so to <i>shatter</i> and scatter it that it can not be rallied or

<p>A <i>brutish</i> man simply follows his <i>animal</i> instincts, without

what a brute might possess; much the same is true of
<i>animal</i>, except that <i>animal</i> leans more to the side of sensuality,
<i>brute</i> to that of force, as appears in the familiar phrase "<i>brute</i>
force." Hunger is an <i>animal</i> appetite; a <i>brute</i> impulse suddenly
prompts one to strike a blow in anger. <i>Bestial</i>, in modern usage,
implies an intensified and degrading animalism. Any supremacy
of the <i>animal</i> or <i>brute</i> instincts over the intellectual and spiritual
in man is <i>base</i> and <i>vile</i>. <i>Beastly</i> refers largely to the outward

<p>To <i>burn</i> is to subject to the action of fire, or of intense heat so
as to effect either partial change or complete combustion; as, to
<i>burn</i> wood in the fire; to <i>burn</i> one's hand on a hot stove; the sun
<i>burns</i> the face. One <i>brands</i> with a hot iron, but <i>cauterizes</i> with
some corrosive substance, as silver nitrate. <i>Cremate</i> is now used
specifically for <i>consuming</i> a dead body by intense heat. To <i>incinerate</i>
is to reduce to ashes; the sense differs little from that of
<i>cremate</i>, but it is in less popular use. To <i>kindle</i> is to <i>set on fire</i>,
as if with a candle; <i>ignite</i> is the more learned and scientific word
for the same thing, extending even to the heating of metals to a
state of incandescence without burning. To <i>scorch</i> and to <i>singe</i>

</table>

<p>A <i>business</i> is what one follows regularly; an <i>occupation</i> is
what he happens at any time to be engaged in; trout-fishing may
be one's <i>occupation</i> for a time, as a relief from <i>business</i>; <i>business</i>
is ordinarily for profit, while the <i>occupation</i> may be a matter of
learning, philanthropy, or religion. A <i>profession</i> implies scholarship;
as, the learned <i>professions</i>. <i>Pursuit</i> is an <i>occupation</i>
which one follows with ardor. An <i>avocation</i> is what calls one
away from other work; a <i>vocation</i> or <i>calling</i>, that to which one
is called by some special fitness or sense of duty; thus, we speak
of the gospel ministry as a <i>vocation</i> or <i>calling</i>, rather than a
<i>business</i>. <i>Trade</i> or <i>trading</i> is, in general, the exchanging of one
thing for another; in the special sense, a <i>trade</i> is an <i>occupation</i>
involving manual training and skilled labor; as, the ancient Jews
held that every boy should learn a <i>trade</i>. A <i>transaction</i> is a
single action, whether in <i>business</i>, diplomacy, or otherwise; <i>affair</i>
has a similar, but lighter meaning; as, this little <i>affair</i>; an important
<i>transaction</i>. The plural <i>affairs</i> has a distinctive meaning,
including all activities where men deal with one another on
any considerable scale; as, a man of <i>affairs</i>. A <i>job</i> is a piece of
work viewed as a single undertaking, and ordinarily paid for as
such. <i>Trade</i> and <i>commerce</i> may be used as equivalents, but <i>trade</i>
is capable of a more limited application; we speak of the <i>trade</i> of
a village, the <i>commerce</i> of a nation. <i>Barter</i> is the direct exchange
of commodities; <i>business</i>, <i>trade</i>, and <i>commerce</i> are chiefly
transacted by means of money, bills of exchange, etc. <i>Business</i>,
<i>occupation</i>, etc., may be what one does independently; <i>employment</i>
may be in the service of another. <i>Work</i> is any application of
energy to secure a result, or the result thus secured; thus, we
speak of the <i>work</i> of God. <i>Art</i> in the industrial sense is a system
of rules and accepted methods for the accomplishment of some
practical result; as, the <i>art</i> of printing; collectively, the <i>arts</i>. A
<i>craft</i> is some occupation requiring technical skill or manual dexterity,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
or the persons, collectively, engaged in its exercise; as,
the weaver's <i>craft</i>.</p>

<p><i>But</i> ranges from the faintest contrast to absolute negation; as,
I am willing to go, <i>but</i> (on the other hand) content to stay; he is
not an honest man, <i>but</i> (on the contrary) a villain. The contrast
may be with a silent thought; as, <i>but</i> let us go (it being understood
that we might stay longer). In restrictive use, <i>except</i> and
<i>excepting</i> are slightly more emphatic than <i>but</i>; we say, no injury
<i>but</i> a scratch; or, no injury <i>except</i> some painful bruises. Such
expressions as "words are <i>but</i> breath" (nothing <i>but</i>) may be
referred to the restrictive use by ellipsis. So may the use of <i>but</i>
in the sense of <i>unless</i>; as, "it never rains <i>but</i> it pours." To the
same head must be referred the conditional use; as, "you may go,
<i>but</i> with your father's consent" (<i>i. e.</i>, "<i>provided</i> you have,"
"<i>except</i> that you must have," etc.). "Doubt <i>but</i>" is now less
used than the more logical "doubt <i>that</i>." <i>But</i> never becomes a
full synonym for <i>and</i>; <i>and</i> adds something like, <i>but</i> adds something
different; "brave <i>and</i> tender" implies that tenderness is
natural to the brave; "brave <i>but</i> tender" implies that bravery
and tenderness are rarely combined. For the concessive use, compare

<p><i>By</i> refers to the agent; <i>through</i>, to the means, cause, or condition;
<i>with</i>, to the instrument. <i>By</i> commonly refers to persons;
<i>with</i>, to things; <i>through</i> may refer to either. The road having
become impassable <i>through</i> long disuse, a way was opened <i>by</i>
pioneers <i>with</i> axes. <i>By</i> may, however, be applied to any object
which is viewed as partaking of action and agency; as, the metal<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
was corroded <i>by</i> the acid; skill is gained <i>by</i> practise. We speak
of communicating <i>with</i> a person <i>by</i> letter. <i>Through</i> implies a
more distant connection than <i>by</i> or <i>with</i>, and more intervening
elements. Material objects are perceived <i>by</i> the mind <i>through</i>
the senses.</p>

<tr><td>conclave,</td><td>conspiracy,</td><td>faction,</td><td>junto.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A <i>conspiracy</i> is a <i>combination</i> of persons for an evil purpose, or
the act of so combining. <i>Conspiracy</i> is a distinct crime under
common, and generally under statutory, law. A <i>faction</i> is more
extensive than a <i>conspiracy</i>, less formal in organization, less definite
in plan. <i>Faction</i> and its adjective, <i>factious</i>, have always an
unfavorable sense. <i>Cabal</i> commonly denotes a <i>conspiracy</i> of leaders.
A <i>gang</i> is a company of workmen all doing the same work
under one leader; the word is used figuratively only of <i>combinations</i>
which it is meant to stigmatize as rude and mercenary; <i>crew</i>
is used in a closely similar sense. A <i>conclave</i> is secret, but of
larger numbers, ordinarily, than a <i>cabal</i>, and may have honorable
use; as, the <i>conclave</i> of cardinals.</p>

<tr><td>compute,</td><td>deem,</td><td>number,</td><td>sum up.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Number</i> is the generic term. To <i>count</i> is to <i>number</i> one by
one. To <i>calculate</i> is to use more complicated processes, as multiplication,
division, etc., more rapid but not less exact. <i>Compute</i>
allows more of the element of probability, which is still more
strongly expressed by <i>estimate</i>. We <i>compute</i> the slain in a great
war from the number known to have fallen in certain great battles;
<i>compute</i> refers to the present or the past, <i>estimate</i> more frequently
to the future; as, to <i>estimate</i> the cost of a proposed building.
To <i>enumerate</i> is to mention item by item; as, to <i>enumerate</i>
one's grievances. To <i>rate</i> is to <i>estimate</i> by comparison, as if the
object were one of a series. We <i>count</i> upon a desired future; we
do not <i>count</i> upon the undesired. As applied to the present, we
<i>reckon</i> or <i>count</i> a thing precious or worthless. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#ESTEEM_v">ESTEEM</a></span>.</p>

<tr><td>bellow,</td><td>ejaculate,</td><td>scream,</td><td>vociferate,</td></tr>
<tr><td>clamor,</td><td>exclaim,</td><td>shout,</td><td>yell.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To <i>call</i> is to send out the voice in order to attract another's attention,
either by word or by inarticulate utterance. Animals
<i>call</i> their mates, or their young; a man <i>calls</i> his dog, his horse,
etc. The sense is extended to include summons by bell, or any
signal. To <i>shout</i> is to <i>call</i> or <i>exclaim</i> with the fullest volume of
sustained voice; to <i>scream</i> is to utter a shriller cry; to <i>shriek</i> or
to <i>yell</i> refers to that which is louder and wilder still. We <i>shout</i>
words; in <i>screaming</i>, <i>shrieking</i>, or <i>yelling</i> there is often no attempt
at articulation. To <i>bawl</i> is to utter senseless, noisy cries, as
of a child in pain or anger. <i>Bellow</i> and <i>roar</i> are applied to the
utterances of animals, and only contemptuously to those of persons.
To <i>clamor</i> is to utter with noisy iteration; it applies also
to the confused cries of a multitude. To <i>vociferate</i> is commonly
applied to loud and excited speech where there is little besides the
exertion of voice. In <i>exclaiming</i>, the utterance may not be strikingly,
tho somewhat, above the ordinary tone and pitch; we
may <i>exclaim</i> by mere interjections, or by connected words, but
always by some articulate utterance. To <i>ejaculate</i> is to throw out
brief, disconnected, but coherent utterances of joy, regret, and
especially of appeal, petition, prayer; the use of such devotional
utterances has received the special name of "ejaculatory prayer."
To <i>cry out</i> is to give forth a louder and more excited utterance
than in <i>exclaiming</i> or <i>calling</i>; one often <i>exclaims</i> with sudden
joy as well as sorrow; if he <i>cries out</i>, it is oftener in grief or
agony. In the most common colloquial usage, to <i>cry</i> is to express
grief or pain by weeping or sobbing. One may <i>exclaim</i>, <i>cry out</i>,
or <i>ejaculate</i> with no thought of others' presence; when he <i>calls</i>, it
is to attract another's attention.</p>

<p>That is <i>calm</i> which is free from disturbance or agitation; in the
physical sense, free from violent motion or action; in the mental<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
or spiritual realm, free from excited or disturbing emotion or
passion. We speak of a <i>calm</i> sea, a <i>placid</i> lake, a <i>serene</i> sky, a
<i>still</i> night, a <i>quiet</i> day, a <i>quiet</i> home. We speak, also, of "<i>still</i>
waters," "<i>smooth</i> sailing," which are different modes of expressing
freedom from manifest agitation. Of mental conditions, one
is <i>calm</i> who triumphs over a tendency to excitement; <i>cool</i>, if he
scarcely feels the tendency. One may be <i>calm</i> by the very reaction
from excitement, or by the oppression of overpowering
emotion, as we speak of the calmness of despair. One is <i>composed</i>
who has subdued excited feeling; he is <i>collected</i> when he
has every thought, feeling, or perception awake and at command.
<i>Tranquil</i> refers to a present state, <i>placid</i>, to a prevailing tendency.
We speak of a <i>tranquil</i> mind, a <i>placid</i> disposition. The <i>serene</i>
spirit dwells as if in the clear upper air, above all storm and
shadow.</p>

<p><i>Cancel</i>, <i>efface</i>, <i>erase</i>, <i>expunge</i>, and <i>obliterate</i> have as their
first meaning the removal of written characters or other forms of
record. To <i>cancel</i> is, literally, to make a lattice by cross-lines,
exactly our English <i>cross out</i>; to <i>efface</i> is to <i>rub off</i>, smooth away
the face, as of an inscription; to <i>erase</i> is to <i>scratch out</i>, commonly
for the purpose of writing something else in the same space; to
<i>expunge</i>, is to punch out with some sharp instrument, so as to
show that the words are no longer part of the writing; to <i>obliterate</i>
is to cover over or remove, as a letter, as was done by reversing
the Roman stylus, and <i>rubbing out</i> with the rounded end what
had been written with the point on the waxen tablet. What has
been <i>canceled</i>, <i>erased</i>, <i>expunged</i>, may perhaps still be traced;
what is <i>obliterated</i> is gone forever, as if it had never been. In<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>

</table>

<p>A <i>candid</i> statement is meant to be true to the real facts and
just to all parties; a <i>fair</i> statement is really so. <i>Fair</i> is applied
to the conduct; <i>candid</i> is not; as, <i>fair</i> treatment, "a <i>fair</i> field,
and no favor." One who is <i>frank</i> has a fearless and unconstrained
truthfulness. <i>Honest</i> and <i>ingenuous</i> unite in expressing contempt
for deceit. On the other hand, <i>artless</i>, <i>guileless</i>, <i>naive</i>,
<i>simple</i>, and <i>unsophisticated</i> express the goodness which comes
from want of the knowledge or thought of evil. As truth is not
always agreeable or timely, <i>candid</i> and <i>frank</i> have often an
objectionable sense; "to be <i>candid</i> with you," "to be perfectly
<i>frank</i>," are regarded as sure preludes to something disagreeable.
<i>Open</i> and <i>unreserved</i> may imply unstudied truthfulness or defiant
recklessness; as, <i>open</i> admiration, <i>open</i> robbery. There may be

<p><i>Care</i> concerns what we possess; <i>anxiety</i>, often, what we do
not; riches bring many <i>cares</i>; poverty brings many <i>anxieties</i>.
<i>Care</i> also signifies watchful <i>attention</i>, in view of possible harm;
as, "This side up with <i>care</i>;" "Take <i>care</i> of yourself;" or, as a
sharp warning, "Take <i>care</i>!" <i>Caution</i> has a sense of possible
harm and risk only to be escaped, if at all, by careful deliberation
and observation. <i>Care</i> inclines to the positive, <i>caution</i> to the
negative; <i>care</i> is shown in doing, <i>caution</i> largely in not doing.
<i>Precaution</i> is allied with <i>care</i>, <i>prudence</i> with <i>caution</i>; a man
rides a dangerous horse with <i>care</i>; <i>caution</i> will keep him from
mounting the horse; <i>precaution</i> looks to the saddle-girths, bit
and bridle, and all that may make the rider secure. <i>Circumspection</i>
is watchful observation and calculation, but without the
timidity implied in <i>caution</i>. <i>Concern</i> denotes a serious interest,
milder than <i>anxiety</i>; as, <i>concern</i> for the safety of a ship at sea.
<i>Heed</i> implies <i>attention</i> without disquiet; it is now largely displaced
by <i>attention</i> and <i>care</i>. <i>Solicitude</i> involves especially the
element of desire, not expressed in <i>anxiety</i>, and of hopefulness,
not implied in <i>care</i>. A parent feels constant <i>solicitude</i> for his
children's welfare, <i>anxiety</i> as to dangers that threaten it, with
<i>care</i> to guard against them. <i>Watchfulness</i> recognizes the possibility
of danger, <i>wariness</i> the probability. A man who is not
influenced by <i>caution</i> to keep out of danger may display great
<i>wariness</i> in the midst of it. <i>Care</i> has also the sense of responsibility,
with possible control, as expressed in <i>charge</i>, <i>management</i>,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
<i>oversight</i>; as, these children are under my <i>care</i>; send the money

<p>A <i>caricature</i> is a grotesque <i>exaggeration</i> of striking features

in an absurd or incongruous manner. A <i>burlesque</i> is written
or acted; a <i>caricature</i> is more commonly in sketch or picture. A
<i>parody</i> changes the subject, but keeps the style; a <i>travesty</i> keeps<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the subject, but changes the style; a <i>burlesque</i> does not hold itself
to either subject or style; but is content with a general resemblance
to what it may imitate. A <i>caricature</i>, <i>parody</i>, or <i>travesty</i>
must have an original; a <i>burlesque</i> may be an independent composition.
An account of a schoolboys' quarrel after the general
manner of Homer's Iliad would be a <i>burlesque</i>; the real story of
the Iliad told in newspaper style would be a <i>travesty</i>. An <i>extravaganza</i>

to a correspondent, and <i>brings</i> an answer. <i>Take</i> is often used
in this sense in place of <i>carry</i>; as, <i>take</i> that letter to the office.
<i>Carry</i> often signifies to <i>transport</i> by personal strength, without
reference to the direction; as, that is more than he can <i>carry</i>;
yet, even so, it would not be admissible to say <i>carry</i> it to me, or
<i>carry</i> it here; in such case we must say <i>bring</i>. To <i>lift</i> is simply

<p>A <i>cataclysm</i> or <i>catastrophe</i> is some great convulsion or momentous
event that may or may not be a cause of misery to man.
In <i>calamity</i>, or <i>disaster</i>, the thought of human suffering is always
present. It has been held by many geologists that numerous <i>catastrophes</i>
or <i>cataclysms</i> antedated the existence of man. In literature,
the final event of a drama is the <i>catastrophe</i>, or <i>denouement</i>.
<i>Misfortune</i> ordinarily suggests less of suddenness and violence
than <i>calamity</i> or <i>disaster</i>, and is especially applied to that
which is lingering or enduring in its effects. In history, the end
of every great war or the fall of a nation is a <i>catastrophe</i>, tho
it may not be a <i>calamity</i>. Yet such an event, if not a <i>calamity</i> to
the race, will always involve much individual <i>disaster</i> and <i>misfortune</i>.
Pestilence is a <i>calamity</i>; a defeat in battle, a shipwreck,
or a failure in business is a <i>disaster</i>; sickness or loss of property is
a <i>misfortune</i>; failure to meet a friend is a <i>mischance</i>; the breaking
of a teacup is a <i>mishap</i>.</p>

<p>The efficient <i>cause</i>, that which makes anything to be or be

"There is no effect without a <i>cause</i>." Every man instinctively
recognizes himself acting through will as the <i>cause</i> of his own
actions. The <i>Creator</i> is the Great First <i>Cause</i> of all things. A
<i>condition</i> is something that necessarily precedes a result, but does
not produce it. An <i>antecedent</i> simply precedes a result, with or
without any agency in producing it; as, Monday is the invariable
<i>antecedent</i> of Tuesday, but not the <i>cause</i> of it. The direct antonym
of <i>cause</i> is <i>effect</i>, while that of <i>antecedent</i> is <i>consequent</i>. An
<i>occasion</i> is some event which brings a <i>cause</i> into action at a particular
moment; gravitation and heat are the <i>causes</i> of an avalanche;
the steep incline of the mountain-side is a necessary <i>condition</i>,
and the shout of the traveler may be the <i>occasion</i> of its fall.

<p>To <i>change</i> is distinctively to make a thing other than it has
been, in some respect at least; to <i>exchange</i> to put or take something
else in its place; to <i>alter</i> is ordinarily to <i>change</i> partially, to
make different in one or more particulars. To <i>exchange</i> is often
to transfer ownership; as, to <i>exchange</i> city for country property.
<i>Change</i> is often used in the sense of <i>exchange</i>; as, to <i>change</i>
horses. To <i>transmute</i> is to <i>change</i> the qualities while the substance
remains the same; as, to <i>transmute</i> the baser metals into
gold. To <i>transform</i> is to <i>change</i> form or appearance, with or
without deeper and more essential change; it is less absolute than
<i>transmute</i>, tho sometimes used for that word, and is often used
in a spiritual sense as <i>transmute</i> could not be; "Be ye <i>transformed</i>
by the renewing of your mind," <i>Rom.</i> xii, 2. <i>Transfigure</i>
is, as in its Scriptural use, to change in an exalted and glorious
spiritual way; "Jesus ... was <i>transfigured</i> before them, and
his face did shine as the sun, and his raiment was white as the
light," <i>Matt.</i> xvii, 1, 2. To <i>metamorphose</i> is to make some
remarkable change, ordinarily in external qualities, but often in
structure, use, or chemical constitution, as of a caterpillar into a<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
butterfly, of the stamens of a plant into petals, or of the crystalline
structure of rocks, hence called "metamorphic rocks," as
when a limestone is <i>metamorphosed</i> into a marble. To <i>vary</i> is to
<i>change</i> from time to time, often capriciously. To <i>commute</i> is to
put something easier, lighter, milder, or in some way more favorable
in place of that which is <i>commuted</i>; as, to <i>commute</i> capital
punishment to imprisonment for life; to <i>commute</i> daily fares on a
railway to a monthly payment. To <i>convert</i> (L. <i>con</i>, with, and
<i>verto</i>, turn) is to primarily <i>turn</i> about, and signifies to <i>change</i> in
form, character, use, etc., through a wide range of relations;
iron is <i>converted</i> into steel, joy into grief, a sinner into a saint.
To <i>turn</i> is a popular word for <i>change</i> in any sense short of the
meaning of <i>exchange</i>, being often equivalent to <i>alter</i>, <i>convert</i>,
<i>transform</i>, <i>transmute</i>, etc. We <i>modify</i> or <i>qualify</i> a statement

<i>change</i>, always thought of as surprising and often as disturbing or

by passing from one place or state to another, especially in a natural,
regular, or orderly way; as, the <i>transition</i> from spring to
summer, or from youth to manhood. An <i>innovation</i> is a <i>change</i>
that breaks in upon an established order or custom; as, an <i>innovation</i>
in religion or politics. For the distinctions between the other
words compare the synonyms for <span class="smcl"><a href="#CHANGE_v">CHANGE</a></span>, <i>v.</i> In the religious
sense <i>regeneration</i> is the vital <i>renewing</i> of the soul by the power
of the divine Spirit; <i>conversion</i> is the conscious and manifest
<i>change</i> from evil to good, or from a lower to a higher spiritual
state; as, in <i>Luke</i> xxii, 32, "when thou art <i>converted</i>, strengthen

<p>A <i>circumstance</i> (L. <i>circum</i>, around, and <i>sto</i>, stand), is something
existing or occurring in connection with or relation to some
other fact or event, modifying or throwing light upon the principal
matter without affecting its essential character; an <i>accompaniment</i>
is something that unites with the principal matter, tho
not necessary to it; as, the piano <i>accompaniment</i> to a song; a
<i>concomitant</i> goes with a thing in natural connection, but in a subordinate
capacity, or perhaps in contrast; as, cheerfulness is a
<i>concomitant</i> of virtue. A <i>circumstance</i> is not strictly, nor usually,
an occasion, condition, effect, or result. (See these words under<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
<span class="smcl"><a href="#CAUSE">CAUSE</a></span>.) Nor is the <i>circumstance</i> properly an <i>incident</i>. (See under
<span class="smcl"><a href="#ACCIDENT">ACCIDENT</a></span>.) We say, "My decision will depend upon <i>circumstances</i>"&mdash;not
"upon <i>incidents</i>." That a man wore a blue necktie
would not probably be the cause, occasion, condition, or <i>concomitant</i>
of his committing murder; but it might be a very important
<i>circumstance</i> in identifying him as the murderer. All the <i>circumstances</i>
make up the <i>situation</i>. A certain disease is the cause of a
man's death; his suffering is an <i>incident</i>; that he is in his own
home, that he has good medical attendance, careful nursing, etc.,
are consolatory <i>circumstances</i>. With the same idea of subordination,
we often say, "This is not a <i>circumstance</i> to that." So a

<p>A <i>class</i> is a number or body of persons or objects having common
pursuits, purposes, attributes, or characteristics. A <i>caste</i> is
hereditary; a <i>class</i> may be independent of lineage or descent;
membership in a <i>caste</i> is supposed to be for life; membership in a
<i>class</i> may be very transient; a religious and ceremonial sacredness
attaches to the <i>caste</i>, as not to the <i>class</i>. The rich and the
poor form separate <i>classes</i>; yet individuals are constantly passing
from each to the other; the <i>classes</i> in a college remain the same,
but their membership changes every year. We speak of <i>rank</i>
among hereditary nobility or military officers; of various <i>orders</i>
of the priesthood; by accommodation, we may refer in a general
way to the higher <i>ranks</i>, the lower <i>orders</i> of any society. <i>Grade</i>
implies some regular scale of valuation, and some inherent qualities
for which a person or thing is placed higher or lower in the
scale; as, the coarser and finer <i>grades</i> of wool; a man of an inferior
<i>grade</i>. A <i>coterie</i> is a small company of persons of similar
tastes, who meet frequently in an informal way, rather for social
enjoyment than for any serious purpose. <i>Clique</i> has always an
unfavorable meaning. A <i>clique</i> is always fractional, implying
some greater gathering of which it is a part; the association breaks
up into <i>cliques</i>. Persons unite in a <i>coterie</i> through simple liking<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
for one another; they withdraw into a <i>clique</i> largely through aversion
to outsiders. A <i>set</i>, while exclusive, is more extensive than
a <i>clique</i>, and chiefly of persons who are united by common social
station, etc. <i>Circle</i> is similar in meaning to <i>set</i>, but of wider application;
we speak of scientific and religious as well as of social
<i>circles</i>.</p>

dusty, <i>sponge</i> it, or <i>sponge</i> it off, if soiled; or <i>sponge</i> off a spot.
Furniture, books, etc., are <i>dusted</i>; floors are <i>mopped</i> or <i>scrubbed</i>;
metallic utensils are <i>scoured</i>; a room is <i>swept</i>; soiled garments

<p><i>Clear</i> (L. <i>clarus</i>, bright, brilliant) primarily refers to that
which shines, and impresses the mind through the eye with a<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
sense of luster or splendor. A substance is said to be <i>clear</i> that
offers no impediment to vision&mdash;is not dim, dark, or obscure.
<i>Transparent</i> refers to the medium through which a substance is
seen, <i>clear</i> to the substance itself, without reference to anything
to be seen through it; we speak of a stream as <i>clear</i> when we
think of the water itself; we speak of it as <i>transparent</i> with reference
to the ease with which we see the pebbles at the bottom.
<i>Clear</i> is also said of that which comes to the senses without
dimness, dulness, obstruction, or obscurity, so that there is
no uncertainty as to its exact form, character, or meaning, with
something of the brightness or brilliancy implied in the primary
meaning of the word <i>clear</i>; as, the outlines of the ship were <i>clear</i>
against the sky; a <i>clear</i> view; a <i>clear</i> note; "<i>clear</i> as a bell;" a
<i>clear</i>, frosty air; a <i>clear</i> sky; a <i>clear</i> statement; hence, the word
is used for that which is free from any kind of obstruction; as, a
<i>clear</i> field. <i>Lucid</i> and <i>pellucid</i> refer to a shining clearness, as of
crystal. A <i>transparent</i> body allows the forms and colors of objects
beyond to be seen through it; a <i>translucent</i> body allows
light to pass through, but may not permit forms and colors to be
distinguished; plate glass is <i>transparent</i>, ground glass is <i>translucent</i>.
<i>Limpid</i> refers to a liquid clearness, or that which suggests
it; as, <i>limpid</i> streams. That which is <i>distinct</i> is well defined,
especially in outline, each part or object standing or seeming
apart from any other, not confused, indefinite, or blurred; <i>distinct</i>
enunciation enables the hearer to catch every word or vocal sound
without perplexity or confusion; a <i>distinct</i> statement is free from
indefiniteness or ambiguity; a <i>distinct</i> apprehension of a thought
leaves the mind in no doubt or uncertainty regarding it. That is
<i>plain</i>, in the sense here considered, which is, as it were, level to
the thought, so that one goes straight on without difficulty or
hindrance; as, <i>plain</i> language; a <i>plain</i> statement; a <i>clear</i> explanation.
<i>Perspicuous</i> is often equivalent to <i>plain</i>, but <i>plain</i>
never wholly loses the meaning of <i>unadorned</i>, so that we can say
the style is <i>perspicuous</i> tho highly ornate, when we could not call
it at once ornate and <i>plain</i>. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#EVIDENT">EVIDENT</a></span>.</p>

<i>Shock</i> is the result of <i>collision</i>. In the figurative use, we speak of

A <i>convocation</i> is an <i>assembly</i> called by authority for a special

<p>That is <i>complex</i> which is made up of several connected parts.

In a <i>heterogeneous</i> body unlike parts or particles are
intermingled, often without apparent order or plan. <i>Conglomerate</i>

masses or lumps of various substances. The New England pudding-stone

<p>To <i>condemn</i> is to pass judicial sentence or render judgment or

<i>condemned</i> to imprisonment. To <i>denounce</i> is to make public or

lawful authority; <i>concede</i> a claim. <i>Confess</i> has a high and
sacred use in the religious sense; as, to <i>confess</i> Christ before men.
It may have also a playful sense (often with <i>to</i>); as, one <i>confesses
to</i> a weakness for confectionery. The chief present use of the
word, however, is in the sense of making known to others one's
own wrong-doing; in this sense <i>confess</i> is stronger than <i>acknowledge</i>
or <i>admit</i>, and more specific than <i>own</i>; a person <i>admits</i> a
mistake; <i>acknowledges</i> a fault; <i>confesses</i> sin or crime. Compare

<p><i>Effect</i> is the strongest of these words; it is that which is directly
produced by the action of an efficient cause; we say, "Every
<i>effect</i> must have an adequate cause" (compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#CAUSE">CAUSE</a></span>). In regard
to human actions, <i>effect</i> commonly relates to intention; as,
the shot took <i>effect</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, the <i>effect</i> intended. A <i>consequence</i> is
that which follows an act naturally, but less directly than the
<i>effect</i>. The motion of the piston is the <i>effect</i>, and the agitation of
the water under the paddle-wheels a <i>consequence</i> of the expansion
of steam in the cylinder. The <i>result</i> is, literally, the rebound of
an act, depending on many elements; the <i>issue</i> is that which
flows forth directly; we say the <i>issue</i> of a battle, the <i>result</i> of a
campaign. A <i>consequent</i> commonly is that which follows simply
in order of time, or by logical inference. The <i>end</i> is the actual
<i>outcome</i> without determination of its relation to what has gone
before; it is ordinarily viewed as either the necessary, natural, or
logical <i>outcome</i>, any <i>effect</i>, <i>consequence</i>, or <i>result</i> being termed an
<i>end</i>; as, the <i>end</i> of such a course must be ruin. The <i>event</i> (L. <i>e</i>,

Mutual <i>promises</i> may have the force of a <i>contract</i>. A consideration,

usage, as <i>contract</i> is in law and business. <i>Compact</i> is essentially
the same as <i>contract</i>, but is applied to international <i>agreements</i>,
treaties, etc. A <i>bargain</i> is a mutual <i>agreement</i> for an exchange
of values, without the formality of a <i>contract</i>. A <i>stipulation</i> is

As a general rule, all acts punishable by fine or imprisonment

from some defect of vision. <i>Opaque</i> objects, as smoked glass, are
impervious to light. <i>Murky</i> is said of that which is at once <i>dark</i>,
<i>obscure</i>, and <i>gloomy</i>; as, a <i>murky</i> den; a <i>murky</i> sky. Figuratively,
<i>dark</i> is emblematic of sadness, agreeing with <i>somber</i>, <i>dismal</i>,

<p><i>Deceit</i> is the habit, <i>deception</i> the act; <i>guile</i> applies to the
disposition out of which <i>deceit</i> and <i>deception</i> grow, and also to
their actual practise. A <i>lie</i>, <i>lying</i>, or <i>falsehood</i>, is the uttering of
what one knows to be false with intent to deceive. The novel or
drama is not a <i>lie</i>, because not meant to deceive; the ancient
teaching that the earth was flat was not a <i>lie</i>, because not then
known to be false. <i>Untruth</i> is more than lack of accuracy, implying
always lack of veracity; but it is a somewhat milder and
more dignified word than <i>lie</i>. <i>Falsehood</i> and <i>lying</i> are in utterance;
<i>deceit</i> and <i>deception</i> may be merely in act or implication. <i>Deception</i>
may be innocent, and even unintentional, as in the case of
an optical illusion; <i>deceit</i> always involves injurious intent. <i>Craft</i>
and <i>cunning</i> have not necessarily any moral quality; they are
common traits of animals, but stand rather low in the human
scale. <i>Duplicity</i> is the habitual speaking or acting with intent to
appear to mean what one does not. <i>Dissimulation</i> is rather a
concealing of what is than a pretense of what is not. <i>Finesse</i> is
simply an adroit and delicate management of a matter for one's
own side, not necessarily involving <i>deceit</i>. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#ARTIFICE">ARTIFICE</a></span>;

<p>The hand may be <i>defiled</i> by a touch of pitch; swine that have
been wallowing in the mud are <i>befouled</i>. <i>Contaminate</i> and <i>infect</i>
refer to something evil that deeply pervades and permeates,
as the human body or mind. <i>Pollute</i> is used chiefly of liquids; as,
water <i>polluted</i> with sewage. <i>Tainted</i> meat is repulsive; <i>infected</i>
meat contains germs of disease. A <i>soiled</i> garment may be cleansed
by washing; a <i>spoiled</i> garment is beyond cleansing or repair.
Bright metal is <i>tarnished</i> by exposure; a fair sheet is <i>sullied</i> by a
dirty hand. In figurative use, <i>defile</i> may be used merely in the
ceremonial sense; "they themselves went not into the judgment
hall, lest they should be <i>defiled</i>," <i>John</i> xviii, 28; <i>contaminate</i> refers
to deep spiritual injury. <i>Pollute</i> has also a reference to sacrilege;
as, to <i>pollute</i> a sanctuary, an altar, or an ordinance. The
innocent are often <i>contaminated</i> by association with the wicked;
the vicious are more and more <i>corrupted</i> by their own excesses.

may simply throw light upon some point of special difficulty.
An <i>exposition</i> undertakes to state more fully what is compactly
given or only implied in the text; as, an <i>exposition</i> of Scripture.
<i>Interpretation</i> is ordinarily from one language into another, or
from the language of one period into that of another; it may also<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
be a statement giving the doubtful or hidden meaning of that
which is recondite or perplexing; as, the <i>interpretation</i> of a

<i>exposition</i>, and <i>interpretation</i> are ordinarily blended in a

<p>An individual <i>considers</i>, <i>meditates</i>, <i>ponders</i>, <i>reflects</i>, by himself;
he <i>weighs</i> a matter in his own mind, and is sometimes said
even to <i>debate</i> with himself. <i>Consult</i> and <i>confer</i> always imply
two or more persons, as does <i>debate</i>, unless expressly limited as
above. <i>Confer</i> suggests the interchange of counsel, advice, or information;
<i>consult</i> indicates almost exclusively the receiving of
it. A man <i>confers</i> with his associates about a new investment;
he <i>consults</i> his physician about his health; he may <i>confer</i> with
him on matters of general interest. He <i>consults</i> a dictionary, but
does not <i>confer</i> with it. <i>Deliberate</i>, which can be applied to a
single individual, is also the word for a great number, while
<i>consult</i> is ordinarily limited to a few; a committee <i>consults</i>; an
assembly <i>deliberates</i>. <i>Deliberating</i> always carries the idea of
slowness; <i>consulting</i> is compatible with haste; we can speak of a
hasty consultation, not of a hasty deliberation. <i>Debate</i> implies
opposing views; <i>deliberate</i>, simply a gathering and balancing of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
all facts and reasons. We <i>consider</i> or <i>deliberate</i> with a view to

than as he sees it, as when in a mirage distant springs and

the absolute and necessary result of the admission of certain premises;
an <i>inference</i> is a probable <i>conclusion</i> toward which known

<p><i>Design</i> refers to the adaptation of means to an <i>end</i>, the correspondence
and coordination of parts, or of separate acts, to produce
a result; <i>intent</i> and <i>purpose</i> overleap all particulars, and fasten on
the <i>end</i> itself. <i>Intention</i> is simply the more familiar form of the
legal and philosophical <i>intent</i>. <i>Plan</i> relates to details of form,
structure, and action, in themselves; <i>design</i> considers these same
details all as a means to an <i>end</i>. The <i>plan</i> of a campaign may be
for a series of sharp attacks, with the <i>design</i> of thus surprising and
overpowering the enemy. A man comes to a fixed <i>intention</i> to
kill his enemy; he forms a <i>plan</i> to entrap him into his power,
with the <i>design</i> of then compassing his death; as the law can not
read the heart, it can only infer the <i>intent</i> from the evidences of
<i>design</i>. <i>Intent</i> denotes a straining, stretching forth toward an <i>object</i>;
<i>purpose</i> simply the placing it before oneself; hence, we
speak of the <i>purpose</i> rather than the <i>intent</i> or <i>intention</i> of God.
We hold that the marks of <i>design</i> in nature prove it the work of
a great Designer. <i>Intention</i> contemplates the possibility of
failure; <i>purpose</i> looks to assured success; <i>intent</i> or <i>intention</i> refers
especially to the state of mind of the actor; <i>purpose</i> to the

strong or decided <i>inclination</i> we do not express the intensity of
<i>desire</i>. <i>Desire</i> has a wide range, from the highest objects to the
lowest; <i>desire</i> is for an object near at hand, or near in thought,
and viewed as attainable; a <i>wish</i> may be for what is remote or
uncertain, or even for what is recognized as impossible. <i>Craving</i>
is stronger than <i>hankering</i>; <i>hankering</i> may be the result of a fitful
and capricious <i>appetite</i>; <i>craving</i> may be the imperious and
reasonable demand of the whole nature. <i>Longing</i> is a reaching
out with deep and persistent demand for that which is viewed as
now distant but at some time attainable; as, the captive's <i>longing</i>
for release. <i>Coveting</i> ordinarily denotes wrong <i>desire</i> for that

<i>Diction</i> is general; <i>wording</i> is limited; we speak of the <i>diction</i>

<i>Disparity</i> is stronger than <i>inequality</i>, implying that one thing
falls far below another; as, the <i>disparity</i> of our achievements

sharply contrasted; there may be a <i>difference</i> between those almost
alike. There is a <i>discrepancy</i> in accounts that fail to balance.
<i>Variety</i> involves more than two objects; so, in general,
does <i>diversity</i>; <i>variation</i> is a <i>difference</i> in the condition or action

<p><i>Arduous</i> (L. <i>arduus</i>, steep) signifies primarily so steep and lofty
as to be difficult of ascent, and hence applies to that which involves
great and sustained exertion and ordinarily for a lofty aim; great
learning can only be won by <i>arduous</i> toil. <i>Hard</i> applies to anything
that resists our endeavors as a scarcely penetrable mass resists
our physical force. Anything is <i>hard</i> that involves tax and
strain whether of the physical or mental powers. <i>Difficult</i> is not
used of that which merely taxes physical force; a dead lift is
called <i>hard</i> rather than <i>difficult</i>; breaking stone on the road
would be called <i>hard</i> rather than <i>difficult</i> work; that is <i>difficult</i>
which involves skill, sagacity, or address, with or without a considerable
expenditure of physical force; a geometrical problem
may be <i>difficult</i> to solve, a tangled skein to unravel; a mountain
<i>difficult</i> to ascend. <i>Hard</i> may be active or passive; a thing may
be <i>hard</i> to do or <i>hard</i> to bear. <i>Arduous</i> is always active. That
which is <i>laborious</i> or <i>toilsome</i> simply requires the steady application
of labor or toil till accomplished; <i>toilsome</i> is the stronger
word. That which is <i>onerous</i> (L. <i>onus</i>, a burden) is mentally burdensome
or oppressive. Responsibility may be <i>onerous</i> even when
it involves no special exertion.</p>

<p>The <i>direction</i> of an object is the line of motion or of vision

conversationally, <i>way</i> is almost a perfect synonym of <i>direction</i>;
as, which <i>way</i> did he go? or, in which <i>direction</i>? <i>Bearing</i> is the
<i>direction</i> in which an object is seen with reference to another, and
especially with reference to the points of the compass. <i>Course</i>
is the <i>direction</i> of a moving object; <i>inclination</i>, that toward which
a stationary object leans; <i>tendency</i>, the <i>direction</i> toward which
anything stretches or reaches out; <i>tendency</i> is stronger and more

<p><i>Disease</i> is the general term for any deviation from health; in
a more limited sense it denotes some definite morbid condition;
<i>disorder</i> and <i>affection</i> are rather partial and limited; as, a nervous
<i>affection</i>; a <i>disorder</i> of the digestive system. <i>Sickness</i> was
generally used in English speech and literature, till the close of
the eighteenth century at least, for every form of physical <i>disorder</i>,
as abundantly appears in the English Bible: "Jesus went
about ... healing all manner of <i>sickness</i> and all manner of <i>disease</i>
among the people," <i>Matt.</i> iv, 23; "Elisha was fallen <i>sick</i> of
his <i>sickness</i> whereof he died," <i>2 Kings</i> xiii, 14. There is now, in
England, a tendency to restrict the words <i>sick</i> and <i>sickness</i> to
nausea, or "<i>sickness</i> at the stomach," and to hold <i>ill</i> and <i>illness</i> as
the only proper words to use in a general sense. This distinction
has received but a very limited acceptance in the United States,
where <i>sick</i> and <i>sickness</i> have the earlier and wider usage. We
speak of trifling <i>ailments</i>, a slight <i>indisposition</i>, a serious or a
deadly <i>disease</i>; a slight or severe <i>illness</i>; a painful <i>sickness</i>.
<i>Complaint</i> is a popular term, which may be applied to any degree
of ill health, slight or severe. <i>Infirmity</i> denotes a chronic or
lingering weakness or disability, as blindness or lameness.</p>

</table>

<p><i>Do</i> is the one comprehensive word which includes this whole
class. We may say of the least item of daily work, "It is <i>done</i>,"
and of the grandest human achievement, "Well <i>done</i>!" <i>Finish</i>
and <i>complete</i> signify to bring to an end what was previously begun;
there is frequently the difference in usage that <i>finish</i> is applied to
the fine details and is superficial, while <i>complete</i> is comprehensive,
being applied to the whole ideal, plan, and execution; as, to <i>finish</i>
a statue; to <i>complete</i> a scheme of philosophy. To <i>discharge</i> is to
<i>do</i> what is given in charge, expected, or required; as, to <i>discharge</i>
the duties of the office. To <i>fulfil</i> is to <i>do</i> or to be what has been
promised, expected, hoped, or desired; as, a son <i>fulfils</i> a father's
hopes. <i>Realize</i>, <i>effect</i>, <i>execute</i>, and <i>consummate</i> all signify to embody
in fact what was before in thought. One may <i>realize</i> that
which he has done nothing to <i>bring about</i>; he may <i>realize</i> the
dreams of youth by inheriting a fortune; but he can not <i>effect</i> his
early designs except by <i>doing</i> the utmost that is necessary to make
them fact. <i>Effect</i> includes all that is <i>done</i> to <i>accomplish</i> the intent;
<i>execute</i> refers rather to the final steps; <i>consummate</i> is limited
quite sharply to the concluding act. An officer <i>executes</i> the law
when he proceeds against its violators; a purchase is <i>consummated</i>
when the money is paid and the property delivered. <i>Execute</i>
refers more commonly to the commands of another, <i>effect</i>
and <i>consummate</i> to one's own designs; as, the commander <i>effected</i>
the capture of the fort, because his officers and men promptly <i>executed</i>
his commands. <i>Achieve</i>&mdash;to <i>do</i> something worthy of a chief&mdash;signifies<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
always to <i>perform</i> some great and generally some worthy
exploit. <i>Perform</i> and <i>accomplish</i> both imply working toward
the end; but <i>perform</i> always allows a possibility of not attaining,
while <i>accomplish</i> carries the thought of full completion. In Longfellow's
lines, "Patience; <i>accomplish</i> thy labor," etc., <i>perform</i>
could not be substituted without great loss. As between <i>complete</i>
and <i>accomplish</i>, <i>complete</i> considers rather the thing as <i>done</i>; <i>accomplish</i>,
the whole process of doing it. <i>Commit</i>, as applied to
actions, is used only of those that are bad, whether grave or trivial;
<i>perpetrate</i> is used chiefly of aggravated crimes or, somewhat
humorously, of blunders. A man may <i>commit</i> a sin, a trespass, or
a murder; <i>perpetrate</i> an outrage or a felony. We <i>finish</i> a garment
or a letter, <i>complete</i> an edifice or a life-work, <i>consummate</i> a
bargain or a crime, <i>discharge</i> a duty, <i>effect</i> a purpose, <i>execute</i> a
command, <i>fulfil</i> a promise, <i>perform</i> our daily tasks, <i>realize</i> an
ideal, <i>accomplish</i> a design, <i>achieve</i> a victory. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#TRANSACT">TRANSACT</a></span>;

<p><i>Doctrine</i> primarily signifies that which is taught; <i>principle</i>,
the fundamental basis on which the <i>teaching</i> rests. A <i>doctrine</i> is
reasoned out, and may be defended by reasoning; a <i>dogma</i> rests
on authority, as of direct revelation, the decision of the church,
etc. A <i>doctrine</i> or <i>dogma</i> is a statement of some one item of <i>belief</i>;
a <i>creed</i> is a summary of <i>doctrines</i> or <i>dogmas</i>. <i>Dogma</i> has<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
commonly, at the present day, an offensive signification, as of a
<i>belief</i> arrogantly asserted. <i>Tenet</i> is simply that which is held,
and is applied to a single item of <i>belief</i>; it is a neutral word,
neither approving nor condemning; we speak of the <i>doctrines</i> of
our own church; of the <i>tenets</i> of others. A <i>precept</i> relates not
to <i>belief</i>, but to conduct. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#FAITH">FAITH</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#LAW">LAW</a></span>.</p>

</table>

<p><i>Dogmatic</i> is technically applied in a good sense to that which
is formally enunciated by adequate authority; <i>doctrinal</i> to that
which is stated in the form of doctrine to be taught or defended.
<i>Dogmatic</i> theology, called also "dogmatics," gives definite propositions,
which it holds to be delivered by authority; <i>systematic</i>
theology considers the same propositions in their logical connection
and order as parts of a system; a <i>doctrinal</i> statement is less
absolute in its claims than a <i>dogmatic</i> treatise, and may be more
partial than the term <i>systematic</i> would imply. Outside of theology,
<i>dogmatic</i> has generally an offensive sense; a <i>dogmatic</i> statement
is one for which the author does not trouble himself to give a
reason, either because of the strength of his convictions, or because
of his contempt for those whom he addresses; thus <i>dogmatic</i> is,
in common use, allied with <i>arrogant</i> and kindred words.</p>

<p>To <i>doubt</i> is to lack conviction. Incompleteness of evidence

<p><i>Doubt</i> is a lack of conviction that may refer either to matters
of belief or to matters of practise. As regards belief, while
<i>doubt</i> is lack of conviction, <i>disbelief</i> is conviction, to the contrary;
<i>unbelief</i> refers to a settled state of mind, generally accompanied
with opposition of heart. <i>Perplexity</i> is active and painful; <i>doubt</i>
may be quiescent. <i>Perplexity</i> presses toward a solution; <i>doubt</i>
may be content to linger unresolved. Any improbable statement
awakens <i>incredulity</i>. In theological usage <i>unbelief</i> and <i>skepticism</i>
have a condemnatory force, as implying wilful rejection of
manifest truth. As regards practical matters, <i>uncertainty</i> applies
to the unknown or undecided; <i>doubt</i> implies some negative
evidence. <i>Suspense</i> regards the future, and is eager and anxious;
<i>uncertainty</i> may relate to any period, and be quite indifferent.
<i>Misgiving</i> is ordinarily in regard to the outcome of something
already done or decided; <i>hesitation</i>, <i>indecision</i>, and <i>irresolution</i>
have reference to something that remains to be decided or done,
and are due oftener to infirmity of will than to lack of knowledge.
<i>Distrust</i> and <i>suspicion</i> apply especially to the motives, character,
etc., of others, and are more decidedly adverse than <i>doubt</i>.
<i>Scruple</i> relates to matters of conscience and duty.</p>

state, which is different from normal sleep or wakefulness.
A <i>reverie</i> is a purposeless drifting of the mind when awake,
under the influence of mental images; a <i>day-dream</i> that which
passes before the mind in such condition. A <i>fancy</i> is some image
presented to the mind, often in the fullest exercise of its powers.
<i>Hallucination</i> is the seeming perception of non-existent objects,
as in insanity or delirium. In the figurative sense, we speak of

<tr><td>compel,</td><td>propel,</td><td>repel,</td><td>resist,</td><td>thrust,</td></tr>
<tr><td>impel,</td><td>push,</td><td>repulse,</td><td>ride,</td><td>urge on.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To <i>drive</i> is to move an object with some force or violence before
or away from oneself; it is the direct reverse of <i>draw</i>, <i>lead</i>,
etc. A man leads a horse by the halter, <i>drives</i> him with whip
and rein. One may be <i>driven</i> to a thing or from it; hence, <i>drive</i>
is a synonym equally for <i>compel</i> or for <i>repel</i> or <i>repulse</i>. <i>Repulse</i>
is stronger and more conclusive than <i>repel</i>; one may be <i>repelled</i>
by the very aspect of the person whose favor he seeks, but is not
<i>repulsed</i> except by the direct refusal or ignoring of his suit. A
certain conventional modern usage, especially in England, requires
us to say that we <i>drive</i> in a carriage, <i>ride</i> upon a horse;
tho in Scripture we read of <i>riding</i> in a chariot (<i>2 Kings</i> ix, 16;
<i>Jer.</i> xvii, 25, etc.); good examples of the same usage may be<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
found abundantly in the older English. The propriety of a person's
saying that he is going to <i>drive</i> when he is simply to be conveyed
in a carriage, where some one else, as the coachman, does
all the <i>driving</i>, is exceedingly questionable. Many good authorities
prefer to use <i>ride</i> in the older and broader sense as signifying
to be supported and borne along by any means of conveyance.

<p>A <i>copy</i> is as nearly like the original as the copyist has power
to make it; a <i>duplicate</i> is exactly like the original; a carbon <i>copy</i>
of a typewritten document must be a <i>duplicate</i>; we may have an
inaccurate <i>copy</i>, but never an inaccurate <i>duplicate</i>. A <i>facsimile</i>
is like the original in appearance; a <i>duplicate</i> is the same as the
original in substance and effect; a <i>facsimile</i> of the Declaration of
Independence is not a <i>duplicate</i>. A <i>facsimile</i> of a key might be
quite useless; a <i>duplicate</i> will open the lock. A <i>counterpart</i> exactly
corresponds to another object, but perhaps without design,
while a <i>copy</i> is intentional. An <i>imitation</i> is always thought of as
inferior to the original; as, an <i>imitation</i> of Milton. A <i>replica</i> is
a <i>copy</i> of a work of art by the maker of the original. In law, a
<i>copy</i> of an instrument has in itself no authority; the signatures,
as well as other matters, may be copied; a <i>duplicate</i> is really an
original, containing the same provisions and signed by the same
persons, so that it may have in all respects the same force and effect;
a <i>transcript</i> is an official <i>copy</i>, authenticated by the signature
of the proper officer, and by the seal of the appropriate court.
While strictly there could be but one <i>duplicate</i>, the word is now
extended to an indefinite number of exact <i>copies</i>. <i>Reproduction</i>
is chiefly applied to living organisms.</p>

<p>Etymologically, <i>duty</i> is that which is owed or due; <i>obligation</i>,
that to or by which one is bound; <i>right</i>, that which is correct,
straight, or in the direct line of truth and goodness; <i>responsibility</i>,
that for which one must answer. <i>Duty</i> and <i>responsibility</i>
are thought of as to some person or persons; <i>right</i> is impersonal.
One's <i>duty</i> may be to others or to himself; his <i>obligations</i> and
<i>responsibilities</i> are to others. <i>Duty</i> arises from the nature of
things; <i>obligation</i> and <i>responsibility</i> may be created by circumstances,
as by one's own promise, or by the acceptance of a trust,
etc. We speak of a parent's <i>duty</i>, a debtor's <i>obligation</i>; or of a
child's <i>duty</i> of obedience, and a parent's <i>responsibility</i> for the
child's welfare. <i>Right</i> is that which accords with the moral system
of the universe. <i>Righteousness</i> is <i>right</i> incarnated in action.
In a more limited sense, <i>right</i> may be used of what one may
rightly claim, and so be the converse of <i>duty</i>. It is the creditor's
<i>right</i> to demand payment, and the debtor's <i>duty</i> to pay. Compare

<p><i>Ease</i> in the sense here considered denotes freedom from conscious

condition or of action; <i>facility</i> is always of action; <i>readiness</i> is of
action or of expected action. One lives at <i>ease</i> who has no pressing
cares; one stands at <i>ease</i>, moves or speaks with <i>ease</i>, when
wholly without constraint. <i>Facility</i> is always active; <i>readiness</i>
may be active or passive; the speaker has <i>facility</i> of expression,
<i>readiness</i> of wit; any appliance is in <i>readiness</i> for use. <i>Ease</i> of
action may imply merely the possession of ample power; <i>facility</i>
always implies practise and skill; any one can press down the
keys of a typewriter with <i>ease</i>; only the skilled operator works
the machine with <i>facility</i>. <i>Readiness</i> in the active sense includes
much of the meaning of <i>ease</i> with the added idea of promptness
or alertness. <i>Easiness</i> applies to the thing done, rather than to
the doer. <i>Expertness</i> applies to the more mechanical processes of
body and mind; we speak of the <i>readiness</i> of an orator, but of

<p><i>Education</i> (L. <i>educere</i>, to lead or draw out) is the systematic
development and cultivation of the mind and other natural powers.
"<i>Education</i> is the harmonious development of all our faculties.
It begins in the nursery, and goes on at school, but does
not end there. It continues through life, whether we will or not....
'Every person,' says Gibbon, 'has two educations, one
which he receives from others, and one more important, which he
gives himself.'" <span class="smc">John Lubbock</span> <i>The Use of Life</i> ch. vii, p. 111.
[<span class="smc">Macm.</span> '94.] <i>Instruction</i>, the impartation of <i>knowledge</i> by
others (L. <i>instruere</i>, to build in or into) is but a part of education,
often the smallest part. <i>Teaching</i> is the more familiar and less
formal word for <i>instruction</i>. <i>Training</i> refers not merely to the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
impartation of <i>knowledge</i>, but to the exercising of one in actions
with the design to form habits. <i>Discipline</i> is systematic and rigorous
<i>training</i>, with the idea of subjection to authority and perhaps
of punishment. <i>Tuition</i> is the technical term for <i>teaching</i>
as the business of an instructor or as in the routine of a school;
<i>tuition</i> is narrower than <i>teaching</i>, not, like the latter word, including
<i>training</i>. <i>Study</i> is emphatically what one does for himself.
We speak of the <i>teaching</i>, <i>training</i>, or <i>discipline</i>, but not
of the <i>education</i> or <i>tuition</i> of a dog or a horse. <i>Breeding</i> and
<i>nurture</i> include <i>teaching</i> and <i>training</i>, especially as directed by
and dependent upon home life and personal association; <i>breeding</i>
having reference largely to manners with such qualities as are
deemed distinctively characteristic of high birth; <i>nurture</i> (literally
<i>nourishing</i>) having more direct reference to moral qualities,
not overlooking the physical and mental. <i>Knowledge</i> and <i>learning</i>
tell nothing of mental development apart from the capacity
to acquire and remember, and nothing whatever of that moral
development which is included in <i>education</i> in its fullest and
noblest sense; <i>learning</i>, too, may be acquired by one's unaided
industry, but any full <i>education</i> must be the result in great part
of <i>instruction</i>, <i>training</i>, and personal association. <i>Study</i> is
emphatically what one does for himself, and in which <i>instruction</i>
and <i>tuition</i> can only point the way, encourage the student to
advance, and remove obstacles; vigorous, persevering <i>study</i> is
one of the best elements of <i>training</i>. <i>Study</i> is also used in the
sense of the thing studied, a subject to be mastered by <i>study</i>, a
studious pursuit. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#KNOWLEDGE">KNOWLEDGE</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#REFINEMENT">REFINEMENT</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#WISDOM">WISDOM</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Audacity</i>, in the sense here considered, is a reckless defiance of
law, decency, public opinion, or personal rights, claims, or views,
approaching the meaning of <i>impudence</i> or <i>shamelessness</i>, but
always carrying the thought of the personal risk that one disregards
in such defiance; the merely <i>impudent</i> or <i>shameless</i> person
may take no thought of consequences; the <i>audacious</i> person<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
recognizes and recklessly braves them. <i>Hardihood</i> defies and
disregards the rational judgment of men. <i>Effrontery</i> (L. <i>effrons</i>,
barefaced, shameless) adds to <i>audacity</i> and <i>hardihood</i> the special
element of defiance of considerations of propriety, duty, and
respect for others, yet not to the extent implied in <i>impudence</i> or
<i>shamelessness</i>. <i>Impudence</i> disregards what is due to superiors;
<i>shamelessness</i> defies decency. <i>Boldness</i> is forward-stepping courage,
spoken of with reference to the presence and observation of
others; <i>boldness</i>, in the good sense, is courage viewed from the
outside; but the word is frequently used in an unfavorable sense
to indicate a lack of proper sensitiveness and modesty. Compare

<i>Self-assertion</i> is the claim by word, act, or manner of what

own powers or deserts. <i>Conceit</i> is a briefer expression for <i>self-conceit</i>,
with always an offensive implication; <i>self-conceit</i> is ridiculous
or pitiable; <i>conceit</i> arouses resentment. There is a worthy
<i>self-confidence</i> which springs from consciousness of rectitude and
of power equal to demands. <i>Self-assertion</i> at times becomes a
duty; but <i>self-conceit</i> is always a weakness. <i>Self-consciousness</i>
is the keeping of one's thoughts upon oneself, with the constant
anxious question of what others will think. <i>Vanity</i> is an overweening
admiration of self, craving equal admiration from others;
<i>self-consciousness</i> is commonly painful to its possessor, <i>vanity</i>
always a source of satisfaction, except as it fails to receive its
supposed due. <i>Self-esteem</i> is more solid and better founded than

<tr><td>attribute,</td><td>figure,</td><td>image,</td><td>sign,</td><td>symbol,</td><td>token,</td><td>type.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Emblem</i> is the English form of <i>emblema</i>, a Latin word of Greek
origin, signifying a figure beaten out on a metallic vessel by blows
from within; also, a figure inlaid in wood, stone, or other material
as a copy of some natural object. The Greek word <i>symbolon</i>
denoted a victor's wreath, a check, or any object that might be
compared with, or found to correspond with another, whether
there was or was not anything in the objects compared to suggest
the comparison. Thus an <i>emblem</i> resembles, a <i>symbol</i> represents.
An <i>emblem</i> has some natural fitness to suggest that for which it
stands; a <i>symbol</i> has been chosen or agreed upon to suggest something
else, with or without natural fitness; a <i>sign</i> does actually
suggest the thing with or without reason, and with or without intention
or choice. A <i>symbol</i> may be also an <i>emblem</i>; thus the
elements of bread and wine in the Lord's Supper are both appropriate
<i>emblems</i> and his own chosen <i>symbols</i> of suffering and death.
A statement of doctrine is often called a <i>symbol</i> of faith; but it
is not an <i>emblem</i>. On the other hand, the same thing may be
both a <i>sign</i> and a <i>symbol</i>; a letter of the alphabet is a <i>sign</i> which
indicates a sound; but letters are often used as mathematical,
chemical, or astronomical <i>symbols</i>. A <i>token</i> is something given
or done as a pledge or expression of feeling or intent; while the
<i>sign</i> may be unintentional, the <i>token</i> is voluntary; kind looks may
be <i>signs</i> of regard; a gift is a <i>token</i>; a ring, which is a natural <i>emblem</i>
of eternity, and also its accepted <i>symbol</i>, is frequently given
as a <i>token</i> of friendship or love. A <i>figure</i> in the sense here considered
is something that represents an idea to the mind somewhat
as a form is represented to the eye, as in drawing, painting, or
sculpture; as representing a future reality, a <i>figure</i> may be practically
the same as a <i>type</i>. An <i>image</i> is a visible representation,
especially in sculpture, having or supposed to have a close resemblance
to that which it represents. A <i>type</i> is in religion a representation
of a greater reality to come; we speak of one object as
the <i>type</i> of the class whose characteristics it exhibits, as in the
case of animal or vegetable <i>types</i>. An <i>attribute</i> in art is some accessory
used to characterize a <i>figure</i> or scene; the <i>attribute</i> is
often an <i>emblem</i> or <i>symbol</i>; thus the eagle is the <i>attribute</i> of St.
John as an <i>emblem</i> of lofty spiritual vision. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#SIGN">SIGN</a></span>.</p>

</table>

<p>In general terms it may be said that to <i>employ</i> is to devote to
one's purpose, to <i>use</i> is to render subservient to one's purpose;
what is <i>used</i> is viewed as more absolutely an instrument than
what is <i>employed</i>; a merchant <i>employs</i> a clerk; he <i>uses</i> pen and
paper; as a rule, <i>use</i> is not said of persons, except in a degrading
sense; as, the conspirators <i>used</i> him as a go-between. Hence the
expression common in some religious circles "that God would
<i>use</i> me" is not to be commended; it has also the fault of representing
the human worker as absolutely a passive and helpless instrument;
the phrase is altogether unscriptural; the Scripture
says, "We are laborers together with (co-workers with) God."
That which is <i>used</i> is often consumed in the <i>using</i>, or in familiar
phrase <i>used up</i>; as, we <i>used</i> twenty tons of coal last winter; in
such cases we could not substitute <i>employ</i>. A person may be <i>employed</i>
in his own work or in that of another; in the latter case
the service is always understood to be for pay. In this connection
<i>employ</i> is a word of more dignity than <i>hire</i>; a general is <i>employed</i>
in his country's service; a mercenary adventurer is <i>hired</i> to fight
a tyrant's battles. It is unsuitable, according to present usage, to
speak of <i>hiring</i> a pastor; the Scripture, indeed, says of the
preacher, "The laborer is worthy of his hire;" but this sense is
archaic, and <i>hire</i> now implies that the one <i>hired</i> works directly
and primarily for the pay, as expressed in the noun "hireling;"
a Pastor is properly said to be <i>called</i>, or when the business side<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
of the transaction is referred to, <i>engaged</i>, or possibly <i>employed</i>,

end. A speech may be <i>ended</i> almost as soon as begun, because of
the speaker's illness, or of tumult in the audience; in such a case,
the speech is neither <i>closed</i>, <i>completed</i>, nor <i>finished</i>, nor, in the
strict sense, <i>concluded</i>. An argument may be <i>closed</i> with nothing
proved; when an argument is <i>concluded</i> all that is deemed
necessary to prove the point has been stated. To <i>finish</i> is to do
the last thing there is to do; as, "I have <i>finished</i> my course," <i>2
Tim.</i> iv, 7. <i>Finish</i> has come to mean, not merely to <i>complete</i> in
the essentials, but to perfect in all the minute details, as in the expression
"to add the <i>finishing</i> touches." The enumeration is
<i>completed</i>; the poem, the picture, the statue is <i>finished</i>. To <i>terminate</i>
may be either to bring to an arbitrary or to an appropriate
end; as, he <i>terminated</i> his remarks abruptly; the spire <i>terminates</i>
in a cross. A thing <i>stops</i> that comes to rest from motion; or the
motion <i>stops</i> or <i>ceases</i> when the object comes to rest; <i>stop</i> frequently
signifies to bring or come to a sudden and decided cessation
of motion, progress, or action of any kind. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#DO">DO</a></span>;

South America includes all Patagonia, the southern <i>extremity</i> or

<i>Termination</i> is the Latin and more formal word for the Saxon
<i>end</i>, but is chiefly used of time, words, undertakings, or abstractions
of any kind. <i>Expiration</i> signifies the coming to an <i>end</i> in

<p>To <i>attempt</i> is to take action somewhat experimentally with the
hope and purpose of accomplishing a certain result; to <i>endeavor</i>
is to <i>attempt</i> strenuously and with firm and enduring purpose.
To <i>attempt</i> expresses a single act; to <i>endeavor</i>, a continuous
exertion; we say I will <i>endeavor</i> (not I will <i>attempt</i>) while I live.
To <i>attempt</i> is with the view of accomplishing; to <i>essay</i>, with a
view of testing our own powers. To <i>undertake</i> is to accept or
take upon oneself as an obligation, as some business, labor, or
trust; the word often implies complete assurance of success; as,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
I will <i>undertake</i> to produce the witness. To <i>strive</i> suggests little
of the result, much of toil, strain, and contest, in seeking it; I
will <i>strive</i> to fulfil your wishes, <i>i. e.</i>, I will spare no labor and
exertion to do it. <i>Try</i> is the most comprehensive of these words.
The original idea of testing or experimenting is not thought of
when a man says "I will <i>try</i>." To <i>attempt</i> suggests giving up, if
the thing is not accomplished at a stroke; to <i>try</i> implies using
other means and studying out other ways if not at first successful.
<i>Endeavor</i> is more mild and formal; the pilot in the burning pilot-house
does not say "I will <i>endeavor</i>" or "I will <i>attempt</i> to hold
the ship to her course," but "I'll <i>try</i>, sir!"</p>

<p><i>Effort</i> denotes the voluntary putting forth of power to attain
or accomplish some specific thing; it reaches toward a definite
end; <i>exertion</i> is a putting forth of power without special reference
to an object. Every <i>effort</i> is an <i>exertion</i>, but not every
<i>exertion</i> is an <i>effort</i>. <i>Attempt</i> is more experimental than <i>effort</i>,
<i>endeavor</i> less strenuous but more continuous. An <i>effort</i> is a single
act, an <i>endeavor</i> a continued series of acts; an <i>endeavor</i> is
sustained and enduring, and may be lifelong; we do not have a
society of Christian <i>Attempt</i>, or of Christian <i>Effort</i>, but of Christian
<i>Endeavor</i>. A <i>struggle</i> is a violent <i>effort</i> or strenuous <i>exertion</i>.
An <i>essay</i> is an <i>attempt</i>, <i>effort</i>, or <i>endeavor</i> made as a test

<p><i>Bear</i> is the most general of these words; it is metaphorically
to hold up or keep up a burden of care, pain, grief, annoyance, or

disagreeable visitor; a state <i>tolerates</i> a religion which it would be
glad to suppress. To <i>endure</i> is to <i>bear with</i> strain and resistance,
but with conscious power; <i>endure</i> conveys a fuller suggestion
of contest and conquest than <i>bear</i>. One may choose to <i>endure</i>
the pain of a surgical operation rather than take anesthetics; he
<i>permits</i> the thing to come which he must brace himself to <i>endure</i>
when it comes. To <i>afford</i> is to be equal to a pecuniary demand,
<i>i. e.</i>, to be able to <i>bear</i> it. To <i>brook</i> is quietly to <i>put up with</i>

<p>An <i>enemy</i> in private life is one who is moved by hostile feeling
with active disposition to injure; but in military language all who
fight on the opposite side are called <i>enemies</i> or collectively "the
<i>enemy</i>," where no personal animosity may be implied; <i>foe</i>, which
is rather a poetical and literary word, implies intensely hostile
spirit and purpose. An <i>antagonist</i> is one who opposes and is
opposed actively and with intensity of effort; an <i>opponent</i>, one
in whom the attitude of resistance is the more prominent; a <i>competitor</i>,
one who seeks the same object for which another is striving;
<i>antagonists</i> in wrestling, <i>competitors</i> in business, <i>opponents</i>
in debate may contend with no personal ill will; <i>rivals</i> in love,
ambition, etc., rarely avoid inimical feeling. <i>Adversary</i> was
formerly much used in the general sense of <i>antagonist</i> or <i>opponent</i>,
but is now less common, and largely restricted to the hostile
sense; an <i>adversary</i> is ordinarily one who not only opposes another
in fact, but does so with hostile spirit, or perhaps out of
pure malignity; as, the great <i>Adversary</i>. Compare synonyms

<p><i>Enmity</i> is the state of being an enemy or the feeling and disposition
characterizing an enemy (compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#ENEMY">ENEMY</a></span>). <i>Animosity</i> denotes
a feeling more active and vehement, but often less enduring
and determined, than <i>enmity</i>. <i>Enmity</i> distinctly recognizes its
object as an enemy, to be met or dealt with accordingly. <i>Hostility</i>
is <i>enmity</i> in action; the term <i>hostilities</i> between nations denotes
actual armed collision. <i>Bitterness</i> is a resentful feeling
arising from a belief that one has been wronged; <i>acrimony</i> is a
kindred feeling, but deeper and more persistent, and may arise
from the crossing of one's wishes or plans by another, where no
injustice or wrong is felt. <i>Antagonism</i>, as between two competing
authors or merchants, does not necessarily imply <i>enmity</i>, but ordinarily
suggests a shade, at least, of hostile feeling. <i>Malice</i> is a
disposition or intent to injure others, for the gratification of some
evil passion; <i>malignity</i> is intense and violent <i>enmity</i>, <i>hatred</i>, or

in an especially bright and cheerful way, often with that
which excites merriment or laughter; as, he <i>entertained</i> us with

nothing serious or laborious from which to be <i>diverted</i>. To <i>recreate</i>,
literally to re-create, is to engage mind or body in some pleasing
activity that restores strength and energy for serious work.
To <i>beguile</i> is, as it were, to cheat into cheer and comfort by something

<p><i>Entertainment</i> and <i>recreation</i> imply thought and mental occupation,
tho in an agreeable, refreshing way; they are therefore
words of a high order. <i>Entertainment</i>, apart from its special
senses of a public performance or a social party, and predominantly
even there, is used of somewhat mirthful mental delight;
<i>recreation</i> may, and usually does, combine the mental with the
physical. <i>Amusement</i> and <i>pastime</i> are nearly equivalent, the
latter probably the lighter word; many slight things may be
<i>pastimes</i> which we should hardly dignify by the name of <i>amusements</i>.
<i>Sports</i> are almost wholly on the physical plane, tho
involving a certain grade of mental action; fox-hunting, horse-racing,
and baseball are <i>sports</i>. Certain <i>sports</i> may afford <i>entertainment</i>
or <i>recreation</i> to certain persons, according to their individual
tastes; but <i>entertainment</i> and <i>recreation</i> are capable of a
meaning so high as never to be approached by any meaning of
<i>sport</i>. <i>Cheer</i> may be very quiet, as the <i>cheer</i> of a bright fire to
an aged traveler; <i>merriment</i> is with liveliness and laughter; <i>fun</i>
and <i>frolic</i> are apt to be boisterous. <i>Amusement</i> is a form of <i>enjoyment</i>,

<p><i>Equivocal</i> (L. <i>equus</i>, equal, and <i>vox</i>, voice, word) denotes that
which may equally well be understood in either of two or more
ways. <i>Ambiguous</i> (L. <i>ambi</i>, around, and <i>ago</i>, drive, lead) signifies
lacking in distinctness or certainty, obscure or doubtful
through indefiniteness of expression. <i>Ambiguous</i> is applied only
to spoken or written statements; <i>equivocal</i> has other applications.
A statement is <i>ambiguous</i> when it leaves the mind of the reader
or hearer to fluctuate between two meanings, which would fit the
language equally well; it is <i>equivocal</i> when it would naturally be
understood in one way, but is capable of a different interpretation;
an <i>equivocal</i> expression is, as a rule, intentionally deceptive,
while an <i>ambiguous</i> utterance may be simply the result of a want
either of clear thought or of adequate expression. That which is
<i>enigmatical</i> must be guessed like a riddle; a statement may be
purposely made <i>enigmatical</i> in order to provoke thought and
study. That is <i>doubtful</i> which is fairly open to doubt; that is
<i>dubious</i> which has become the subject of doubts so grave as<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
scarcely to fall short of condemnation; as, a <i>dubious</i> reputation.
<i>Questionable</i> may be used nearly in the sense either of <i>dubious</i> or
of <i>doubtful</i>; a <i>questionable</i> statement is one that must be proved
before it can be accepted. To say that one's honesty is <i>questionable</i>
is a mild way of saying that in the opinion of the speaker he is
likely to prove dishonest. <i>Equivocal</i> is sometimes, tho more
rarely, used in this sense. A <i>suspicious</i> character gives manifest
reason to be suspected; a <i>suspicious</i> temper is inclined to suspect
the motives and intentions of others, with or without reason.

<p><i>Esteem</i> and <i>estimate</i> alike imply to set a certain mental value
upon, but <i>esteem</i> is less precise and mercantile than <i>calculate</i> or

so much money. This sense of <i>esteem</i> is now chiefly found in literary
or oratorical style, and in certain conventional phrases; as,
I <i>esteem</i> it an honor, a favor. In popular usage <i>esteem</i>, as said of
persons, denotes a union of respect and kindly feeling and, in the
highest sense, of moral approbation; as, one whom I highly
<i>esteem</i>; the word may be used in a similar sense of material
things or abstractions; as, one whose friendship I <i>esteem</i>; a shell
greatly <i>esteemed</i> for inlaid work. To <i>appreciate</i> anything is to
be deeply or keenly sensible of or sensitive to its qualities or influence,
to see its full import, be alive to its value, importance, or
worth; as, to <i>appreciate</i> beauty or harmony; to <i>appreciate</i> one's
services in a cause; the word is similarly, tho rarely, used of
persons. To <i>prize</i> is to set a high value on for something more
than merely commercial reasons. One may <i>value</i> some object, as
a picture, beyond all price, as a family heirloom, or may <i>prize</i> it
as the gift of an <i>esteemed</i> friend, without at all <i>appreciating</i> its
artistic merit or commercial value. To <i>regard</i> (F. <i>regarder</i>, look
at, observe) is to have a certain mental view favorable or unfavorable;
as, I <i>regard</i> him as a friend; or, I <i>regard</i> him as a villain;
<i>regard</i> has a distinctively favorable sense as applied to institutions,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>

<p><i>Esteem</i> for a person is a favorable opinion on the basis of
worth, especially of moral worth, joined with a feeling of interest

<i>Regard</i> is more personal and less distant than <i>esteem</i>, and adds a
special kindliness; <i>respect</i> is a more distant word than <i>esteem</i>.
<i>Respect</i> may be wholly on one side, while <i>regard</i> is more often
mutual; <i>respect</i> in the fullest sense is given to what is lofty,
worthy, and honorable, or to a person of such qualities; we may
pay an external <i>respect</i> to one of lofty station, regardless of personal
qualities, showing <i>respect</i> for the office. <i>Estimate</i> has more
of calculation; as, my <i>estimate</i> of the man, or of his abilities, is
very high. <i>Estimation</i> involves the idea of calculation or appraisal
with that of <i>esteem</i> or <i>regard</i>, and is especially used of the

<i>incident</i>; we speak of trifling <i>incidents</i>, great <i>events</i>; <i>incidents</i>
of daily life, <i>events</i> of history. <i>Circumstance</i> agrees with <i>incident</i>
in denoting a matter of relatively slight importance, but implies
a more direct connection with the principal matter; "circumstantial
evidence" is evidence from seemingly minor matters
directly connected with a case; "incidental evidence" would be
some evidence that happened unexpectedly to touch it. An <i>occurrence</i>
is, etymologically, that which we run against, without
thought of its origin, connection or tendency. An <i>episode</i> is connected
with the main course of <i>events</i>, like an <i>incident</i> or <i>circumstance</i>,
but is of more independent interest and importance. <i>Outcome</i>
is the Saxon, and <i>event</i> the Latin for expressing the same
original idea. <i>Consequence</i> or <i>result</i> would express more of logical
connection, and be more comprehensive. The <i>end</i> may be
simple cessation; the <i>event</i> is what has been accomplished; the
<i>event</i> of a war is victory or defeat; the <i>end</i> of the war is reached
when a treaty of peace is signed. Since the future is contingent,
<i>event</i> comes to have the meaning of a <i>contingency</i>; as, in the <i>event</i>
of his death, the policy will at once fall due. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#CIRCUMSTANCE">CIRCUMSTANCE</a></span>;

<p><i>All</i> and <i>both</i> are collective; <i>any</i>, <i>each</i>, and <i>every</i> are distributive.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
<i>Any</i> makes no selection and may not reach to the full limits
of <i>all</i>; <i>each</i> and <i>every</i> make no exception or omission, and must
extend to <i>all</i>; <i>all</i> sweeps in the units as part of a total, <i>each</i> and
<i>every</i> proceed through the units to the total. A promise made to
<i>all</i> omits none; a promise made to <i>any</i> may not reach <i>all</i>; a
promise made to <i>every</i> one is so made that no individual shall fail
to be aware of it; a promise made to <i>each</i> is made to the individuals
personally, one by one. <i>Each</i> is thus more individual and
specific than <i>every</i>; <i>every</i> classifies, <i>each</i> individualizes. <i>Each</i>
divides, <i>both</i> unites; if a certain sum is given to <i>each</i> of two persons,
<i>both</i> (together) must receive twice the amount; <i>both</i> must
be aware of what has been separately communicated to <i>each</i>; a
man may fire <i>both</i> barrels of a gun by a single movement; if he
fires <i>each</i> barrel, he discharges them separately. <i>Either</i> properly
denotes one of two, indefinitely, to the exclusion of the other.
The use of <i>either</i> in the sense of <i>each</i> or <i>both</i>, tho sustained by
good authority, is objectionable because ambiguous. His friends
sat on <i>either</i> side of the room would naturally mean on one side
or the other; if the meaning is on <i>both</i> sides, it would be better to
say so.</p>

<p>That is <i>apparent</i> which clearly appears to the senses or to the
mind as soon as the attention is directed toward it; that is <i>evident</i>
of which the mind is made sure by some inference that supplements
the facts of perception; the marks of a struggle were <i>apparent</i>
in broken shrubbery and trampled ground, and the finding of
a mutilated body and a rifled purse made it <i>evident</i> that robbery
and murder had been committed. That is <i>manifest</i> which we can
lay the hand upon; <i>manifest</i> is thus stronger than <i>evident</i>, as
touch is more absolute than sight; that the picture was a modern
copy of an ancient work was <i>evident</i>, and on comparison with the
original its inferiority was <i>manifest</i>. That is <i>obvious</i> which is
directly in the way so that it can not be missed; as, the application
of the remark was <i>obvious</i>. <i>Visible</i> applies to all that can be

<p>From its original sense of <i>sample</i> or <i>specimen</i> (L. <i>exemplum</i>)
<i>example</i> derives the seemingly contradictory meanings, on the one
hand of a <i>pattern</i> or <i>model</i>, and on the other hand of a <i>warning</i>&mdash;a
<i>sample</i> or <i>specimen</i> of what is to be followed, or of what is to
be shunned. An <i>example</i>, however, may be more than a <i>sample</i>
or <i>specimen</i> of any class; it may be the very <i>archetype</i> or <i>prototype</i>
to which the whole class must conform, as when Christ is
spoken of as being an <i>example</i> or leaving an <i>example</i> for his disciples.
<i>Example</i> comes nearer to the possible freedom of the
<i>model</i> than to the necessary exactness of the <i>pattern</i>; often we
can not, in a given case, exactly imitate the best <i>example</i>, but
only adapt its teachings to altered circumstances. In its application
to a person or thing, <i>exemplar</i> can scarcely be distinguished
from <i>example</i>; but <i>example</i> is most frequently used for an act, or
course of action, for which <i>exemplar</i> is not used; as, one sets a
good (or a bad) <i>example</i>. An <i>exemplification</i> is an illustrative
working out in action of a principle or law, without any reference
to its being copied or repeated; an <i>example</i> guides, an <i>exemplification</i>
illustrates or explains. <i>Ensample</i> is the same as <i>example</i>,
but is practically obsolete outside of Scriptural or theological language.

very many cases indicates a lack either of judgment or of self-control,
the word is used frequently in an unfavorable sense.
Careless expenditure in <i>excess</i> of income is <i>extravagance</i>; we
may have also <i>extravagance</i> of language, professions, etc. As
<i>extravagance</i> is <i>excess</i> in outlay, <i>exorbitance</i> is <i>excess</i> in demands,
and especially in pecuniary demands upon others. <i>Overplus</i> and
<i>superabundance</i> denote in the main a satisfactory, and <i>superfluity</i>
an undesirable, <i>excess</i>; <i>lavishness</i> and <i>profusion</i>, a generous,
bountiful, or amiable <i>excess</i>; as, a <i>profusion</i> of fair hair; <i>lavishness</i>
of hospitality. <i>Surplus</i> is neutral, having none of the unfavorable
meaning that often attaches to <i>excess</i>; a <i>surplus</i> is that
which remains over after all demands are met. <i>Redundance</i> or
<i>redundancy</i> refers chiefly to literary style, denoting an <i>excess</i> of
words or matter. <i>Excess</i> in the moral sense is expressed by <i>dissipation</i>,
<i>prodigality</i>, <i>intemperance</i>, etc.</p>

a trust, as a minister and not an originator; the sheriff
<i>executes</i> a writ; the trustee <i>administers</i> an estate, a charity, etc.;
to <i>enforce</i> is to put into effect by force, actual or potential. To
<i>administer</i> the laws is the province of a court of justice; to <i>execute</i>
the laws is the province of a sheriff, marshal, constable, or
other executive officer; to <i>administer</i> the law is to declare or
apply it; to <i>execute</i> the law is to put it in force; for this <i>enforce</i>
is the more general word, <i>execute</i> the more specific. From signifying
to superintend officially some application or infliction, <i>administer</i>
passes by a natural transition to signify <i>inflict</i>, <i>mete out</i>,
<i>dispense</i>, and blows, medicine, etc., are said to be <i>administered</i>:
a usage thoroughly established and reputable in spite of pedantic
objections. <i>Enforce</i> signifies also to present and urge home by
intellectual and moral force; as, to <i>enforce</i> a precept or a duty.

<p><i>Exercise</i>, in the ordinary sense, is the easy natural action of
any power; <i>exertion</i> is the putting of any power to strain and

strength and health and not appreciably weary. But by qualifying
adjectives we may bring <i>exercise</i> up to the full sense of <i>exertion</i>;
as, violent <i>exercise</i>. <i>Exercise</i> is action taken at any time
with a view to employing, maintaining, or increasing power, or
merely for enjoyment; <i>practise</i> is systematic <i>exercise</i> with a view
to the acquirement of facility and skill in some pursuit; a person
takes a walk for <i>exercise</i>, or takes time for <i>practise</i> on the piano.
<i>Practise</i> is also used of putting into action and effect what one
has learned or holds as a theory; as, the <i>practise</i> of law or medicine;
a profession of religion is good, but the <i>practise</i> of it is better.
<i>Drill</i> is systematic, rigorous, and commonly enforced <i>practise</i>

use <i>cost</i> of what we pay for a possession, <i>expense</i> of what we pay
for a service; we speak of the <i>cost</i> of goods, the <i>expense</i> of making

<p><i>Extemporaneous</i>, originally signifying <i>of</i> or <i>from the time</i> or

treatment left to the suggestion of the moment, so that an <i>extemporaneous</i>
speech is understood to be any one that is not read
or recited; <i>impromptu</i> keeps its original sense, denoting something
that springs from the instant; the <i>impromptu</i> utterance is generally
brief, direct, and vigorous; the <i>extemporaneous</i> speech
may chance to be prosy. <i>Offhand</i> is still more emphatic as to
the readiness and freedom of the utterance. <i>Unpremeditated</i> is

We give <i>credence</i> to a report, <i>assent</i> to a proposition or

Goods are sold on <i>credit</i>; we give one <i>credit</i> for good intentions.
<i>Conviction</i> is a <i>belief</i> established by argument or evidence; <i>assurance</i>

<i>assurance</i> of salvation. An <i>opinion</i> is a general conclusion held
as probable, tho without full certainty; a <i>persuasion</i> is a more
confident <i>opinion</i>, involving the heart as well as the intellect. In
religion, a <i>doctrine</i> is a statement of <i>belief</i> regarding a single

is a firm dependence upon a statement as true, or upon a person as
worthy. <i>Reliance</i> is <i>confidence</i> on which we act or are ready to act
unquestioningly; we have a calm <i>reliance</i> upon the uniformity of
nature. <i>Trust</i> is a practical and tranquil resting of the mind upon
the integrity, kindness, friendship, or promises of a person; we
have <i>trust</i> in God. <i>Faith</i> is a union of <i>belief</i> and <i>trust</i>. <i>Faith</i>
is chiefly personal; <i>belief</i> may be quite impersonal; we speak of
<i>belief</i> of a proposition, <i>faith</i> in a promise, because the promise emanates
from a person. But <i>belief</i> in a person is often used with
no appreciable difference from <i>faith</i>. In religion it is common to

<p>An intellectual <i>fancy</i> is a mental <i>image</i> or picture founded
upon slight or whimsical association or resemblance; a <i>conceit</i>
has less of the picturesque and more of the theoretic than a <i>fancy</i>;
a <i>conceit</i> is somewhat aside from the common laws of reasoning,
as a <i>fancy</i> is lighter and more airy than the common mode of
thought. A <i>conceit</i> or <i>fancy</i> may be wholly unfounded, while a
<i>conception</i> always has, or is believed to have, some answering reality.
(Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#REASON_n">REASON</a></span>.) An intellectual <i>fancy</i> or <i>conceit</i> may
be pleasing or amusing, but is never worth serious discussion; we
speak of a mere <i>fancy</i>, a droll or odd <i>conceit</i>. An emotional or
personal <i>fancy</i> is a capricious <i>liking</i> formed with slight reason and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
no exercise of judgment, and liable to fade as lightly as it was
formed. In a broader sense, the <i>fancy</i> signifies the faculty by
which <i>fancies</i> or mental images are formed, associated, or combined.

</table>

<p><i>Fear</i> is the generic term denoting an emotion excited by threatening
evil with a desire to avoid or escape it; <i>fear</i> may be sudden
or lingering, in view of present, of imminent, or of distant and
only possible danger; in the latter sense <i>dread</i> is oftener used.
<i>Horror</i> (etymologically a shivering or shuddering) denotes a
shuddering <i>fear</i> accompanied with abhorrence or such a shock to
the feelings and sensibilities as may exist without <i>fear</i>, as when
one suddenly encounters some ghastly spectacle; we say of a desperate
but fettered criminal, "I looked upon him with <i>horror</i>."
Where <i>horror</i> includes <i>fear</i>, it is <i>fear</i> mingled with abhorrence.
(See <span class="smcl"><a href="#ABHOR">ABHOR</a></span>.) <i>Affright</i>, <i>fright</i>, and <i>terror</i> are always sudden, and
in actual presence of that which is terrible. <i>Fear</i> may overwhelm,
or may nerve one to desperate defense; <i>fright</i> and <i>terror</i> render
one incapable of defense; <i>fear</i> may be controlled by force of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
will; <i>fright</i> and <i>terror</i> overwhelm the will; <i>terror</i> paralyzes,
<i>fright</i> may cause one to fly, to scream, or to swoon. <i>Fright</i>
is largely a matter of the nerves; <i>fear</i> of the intellect and the
imagination; <i>terror</i> of all the faculties, bodily and mental. <i>Panic</i>
is a sudden <i>fear</i> or <i>fright</i>, affecting numbers at once; vast armies
or crowded audiences are liable to <i>panic</i> upon slight occasion. In
a like sense we speak of a financial <i>panic</i>. <i>Dismay</i> is a helpless
sinking of heart in view of some overwhelming peril or sorrow.
<i>Dismay</i> is more reflective, enduring, and despairing than <i>fright</i>;
a horse is subject to <i>fright</i> or <i>terror</i>, but not to <i>dismay</i>. <i>Awe</i> is
a reverential <i>fear</i>. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#ALARM">ALARM</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Bonds</i> may be of cord, leather, or any other substance that can
bind; <i>chains</i> are of linked metal. <i>Manacles</i> and <i>handcuffs</i> are for
the hands, <i>fetters</i> are primarily chains or jointed iron fastenings

<i>Bonds</i>, <i>fetters</i>, and <i>chains</i> are used in a general way for almost<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
any form of restraint. <i>Gyves</i> is now wholly poetic, and the other

<p>A <i>feud</i> is <i>enmity</i> between families, clans, or parties, with acts
of <i>hostility</i> mutually retaliated and avenged; <i>feud</i> is rarely used
of individuals, never of nations. While all the other words of the
group may refer to that which is transient, a <i>feud</i> is long-enduring,
and often hereditary. <i>Dissension</i> is used of a number of persons,
of a party or other organization. <i>Bitterness</i> is in feeling
only; <i>enmity</i> and <i>hostility</i> involve will and purpose to oppose or
injure. A <i>quarrel</i> is in word or act, or both, and is commonly
slight and transient, as we speak of childish <i>quarrels</i>; <i>contention</i>
and <i>strife</i> may be in word or deed; <i>contest</i> ordinarily involves
some form of action. <i>Contest</i> is often used in a good sense, <i>contention</i>
and <i>strife</i> very rarely so. <i>Controversy</i> is commonly in
words; <i>strife</i> extends from verbal <i>controversy</i> to the <i>contests</i> of
armies. <i>Affray</i>, <i>brawl</i>, and <i>broil</i>, like <i>quarrel</i>, are words of inferior
dignity. An <i>affray</i> or <i>broil</i> may arise at a street corner; the
<i>affray</i> always involves physical force; the <i>brawl</i> or <i>broil</i> may be

<p><i>Fiction</i> is now chiefly used of a prose work in narrative form
in which the characters are partly or wholly imaginary, and
which is designed to portray human life, with or without a practical
lesson; a <i>romance</i> portrays what is picturesque or striking,
as a mere <i>fiction</i> may not do; <i>novel</i> is a general name for any continuous
fictitious narrative, especially a love-story; <i>fiction</i> and
<i>novel</i> are used with little difference of meaning, except that <i>novel</i>
characterizes a work in which the emotional element is especially<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
prominent. The moral of the <i>fable</i> is expressed formally; the
lesson of the <i>fiction</i>, if any, is inwrought. A <i>fiction</i> is studied; a
<i>myth</i> grows up without intent. A <i>legend</i> may be true, but can
not be historically verified; a <i>myth</i> has been received as true at
some time, but is now known to be false. A <i>fabrication</i> is designed
to deceive; it is a less odious word than <i>falsehood</i>, but is
really stronger, as a <i>falsehood</i> may be a sudden unpremeditated
statement, while a <i>fabrication</i> is a series of statements carefully
studied and fitted together in order to deceive; the <i>falsehood</i> is all
false; the <i>fabrication</i> may mingle the true with the false. A <i>figment</i>
is something imaginary which the one who utters it may or
may not believe to be true; we say, "That statement is a <i>figment</i>
of his imagination." The <i>story</i> may be either true or false, and
covers the various senses of all the words in the group. <i>Apologue</i>,
a word simply transferred from Greek into English, is the same
as <i>fable</i>. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#ALLEGORY">ALLEGORY</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Fierce</i> signifies having a <i>furious</i> and cruel nature, or being in
a <i>furious</i> and cruel mood, more commonly the latter. It applies
to that which is now intensely excited, or liable to intense and
sudden excitement. <i>Ferocious</i> refers to a state or disposition; that
which is <i>fierce</i> flashes or blazes; that which is <i>ferocious</i> steadily
burns; we speak of a <i>ferocious</i> animal, a <i>fierce</i> passion. A <i>fiery</i>
spirit with a good disposition is quickly excitable in a good cause,
but may not be <i>fierce</i> or <i>ferocious</i>. <i>Savage</i> signifies <i>untrained</i>, <i>uncultivated</i>.
<i>Ferocious</i> always denotes a tendency to violence; it
is more distinctly bloodthirsty than the other words; a person
may be deeply, intensely cruel, and not at all <i>ferocious</i>; a <i>ferocious</i>
countenance expresses habitual ferocity; a <i>fierce</i> countenance
may express habitual fierceness, or only the sudden anger of the
moment. That which is <i>wild</i> is simply unrestrained; the word
may imply no anger or harshness; as, <i>wild</i> delight, <i>wild</i> alarm.</p>

<p><i>Fine</i> (L. <i>finis</i>, end) denotes that which has been brought to a
full end, finished. From this root-sense many derived meanings
branch out, causing words quite remote from each other to be
alike synonyms of <i>fine</i>. That which is truly finished, brought to
an ideal end, is <i>excellent</i> of its kind, and <i>beautiful</i>, if a thing that
admits of beauty; as, a <i>fine</i> house, <i>fine</i> trees, a <i>fine</i> woman, a <i>fine</i>
morning; if a thing that admits of the removal of impurities, it
is not finished till these are removed, and hence <i>fine</i> signifies <i>clarified</i>,
<i>clear</i>, <i>pure</i>, <i>refined</i>; as, <i>fine</i> gold. That which is finished
is apt to be <i>polished</i>, smooth to the touch, minutely exact in outline;
hence <i>fine</i> comes to be a synonym for all words like <i>dainty</i>,
<i>delicate</i>, <i>exquisite</i>; as, <i>fine</i> manners, a <i>fine</i> touch, <i>fine</i> perceptions.
As that which is <i>delicate</i> is apt to be small, by an easy extension
of meaning <i>fine</i> becomes a synonym for <i>slender</i>, <i>slight</i>,
<i>minute</i>, <i>comminuted</i>; as, a <i>fine</i> thread, <i>fine</i> sand; or for <i>filmy</i>,
<i>tenuous</i>, <i>thin</i>; as, a <i>fine</i> lace, <i>fine</i> wire; and as a <i>thin</i> edge is <i>keen</i>,

<p><i>Food</i> is, in the popular sense, whatever one eats in contradistinction
to what one drinks. Thus, we speak of <i>food</i> and drink, of
wholesome, unwholesome, or indigestible <i>food</i>; but in a more
scientific sense whatever, when taken into the digestive organs,
serves to build up structure or supply waste may be termed <i>food</i>;
the word is extended to plants to signify whatever taken in any
way into the organism serves similar purposes; thus, we speak of
liquid <i>food</i>, plant <i>food</i>, etc.; in this wider sense <i>food</i> is closely
synonymous with <i>nutriment</i>, <i>nourishment</i>, and <i>sustenance</i>. <i>Diet</i>
refers to the quantity and quality of <i>food</i> habitually taken, with
reference to preservation of health. <i>Victuals</i> is a plain, homely
word for whatever may be eaten; we speak of choice <i>viands</i>, cold
<i>victuals</i>. <i>Nourishment</i> and <i>sustenance</i> apply to whatever can be
introduced into the system as a means of sustaining life; we say
of a convalescent, he is taking <i>nourishment</i>. <i>Nutriment</i> and
<i>nutrition</i> have more of scientific reference to the vitalizing
principles of various <i>foods</i>; thus, wheat is said to contain a great
amount of <i>nutriment</i>. <i>Regimen</i> considers <i>food</i> as taken by strict
rule, but applies more widely to the whole ordering of life. <i>Fare</i>
is a general word for all table supplies, good or bad; as, sumptuous
<i>fare</i>; wretched <i>fare</i>. <i>Feed</i>, <i>fodder</i>, and <i>provender</i> are used
only of the food of the lower animals, <i>feed</i> denoting anything
consumed, but more commonly grain, <i>fodder</i> denoting hay, cornstalks,
or the like, sometimes called "long <i>feed</i>;" <i>provender</i> is
dry <i>feed</i>, whether grain or hay, straw, etc. <i>Forage</i> denotes any

<p><i>Fortification</i> is the general word for any artificial defensive
work; a <i>fortress</i> is a <i>fortification</i> of especial size and strength; a
<i>fortress</i> is regarded as permanent, and is ordinarily an independent
work; a <i>fort</i> or <i>fortification</i> may be temporary; a <i>fortification</i>
may be but part of a defensive system; we speak of the <i>fortifications</i>
of a city. A <i>citadel</i> is a <i>fortification</i> within a city, or the
fortified inner part of a city or <i>fortress</i>, within which a garrison
may be placed to overawe the citizens, or to which the defenders
may retire if the outer works are captured; the medieval <i>castle</i>
was the fortified residence of a king or baron. <i>Fort</i> is the common
military term for a detached fortified building or enclosure of
moderate size occupied or designed to be occupied by troops. The
<i>fortifications</i> of a modern city usually consist of a chain of <i>forts</i>.
Any defensible place, whether made so by nature or by art, is a
<i>fastness</i> or <i>stronghold</i>.</p>

or soul to endure pain or adversity patiently and determinedly.
<i>Fortitude</i> has been defined as "passive <i>courage</i>," which is a good

<i>courage</i>," or "enduring <i>courage</i>;" it is that quality which is able
not merely to endure pain or trial, but steadily to confront dangers
that can not be actively opposed, or against which one has no
adequate defense; it takes <i>courage</i> to charge a battery, <i>fortitude</i>
to stand still under an enemy's fire. <i>Resolution</i> is of the mind;
<i>endurance</i> is partly physical; it requires <i>resolution</i> to resist temptation,

<p>A man is <i>successful</i> in any case if he achieves or gains what he
seeks; he is known as a <i>successful</i> man if he has achieved or
gained worthy objects of endeavor; he is <i>fortunate</i> or <i>lucky</i> if
advantages have come to him without or beyond his direct planning
or achieving. <i>Lucky</i> is the more common and colloquial, <i>fortunate</i>
the more elegant word; <i>fortunate</i> is more naturally applied
to the graver matters, as we speak of the <i>fortunate</i>, rather than
the <i>lucky</i>, issue of a great battle; <i>lucky</i> more strongly emphasizes
the element of chance, as when we speak of a <i>lucky</i> hit, a <i>lucky</i>
guess, or of one as "born under a <i>lucky</i> star." <i>Favored</i> is used in
a religious sense, implying that one is the object of divine favor.
<i>Happy</i>, in this connection, signifies possessed of the means of happiness.
One is said to be <i>happy</i> or <i>prosperous</i> whether his prosperity
be the result of fortune or of achievement; <i>prospered</i>

<p>A <i>fraud</i> is an act of deliberate <i>deception</i> with the design of
securing something by taking unfair advantage of another. A <i>deceit</i>
or <i>deception</i> may be designed merely to gain some end of one's
own, with no intent of harming another; an <i>imposition</i>, to take<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
some small advantage of another, or simply to make another
ridiculous. An <i>imposture</i> is designed to obtain money, credit, or
position to which one is not entitled, and may be practised by a
street beggar or by the pretender to a throne. All action that is
not honest is <i>dishonesty</i>, but the term <i>dishonesty</i> is generally applied
in business, politics, etc., to deceitful practises which are
not directly criminal. <i>Fraud</i> includes <i>deceit</i>, but <i>deceit</i> may not
reach the gravity of <i>fraud</i>; a <i>cheat</i> is of the nature of <i>fraud</i>, but
of a petty sort; a <i>swindle</i> is more serious than a <i>cheat</i>, involving
larger values and more flagrant <i>dishonesty</i>. <i>Fraud</i> is commonly
actionable at law; <i>cheating</i> and <i>swindling</i> are for the most part
out of the reach of legal proceedings. <i>Treachery</i> is chiefly used
of <i>dishonesty</i> in matters of friendship, social relations, government,
or war; <i>treachery</i> may be more harmful than <i>fraud</i>, but is
not so gross, and is not ordinarily open to legal redress. <i>Treason</i>
is a specific form of <i>treachery</i> of a subject to the government to
which he owes allegiance, and is definable and punishable at law.

</table>

<p><i>Friendly</i>, as said of persons, signifies having the disposition of
a friend; as said of acts, it signifies befitting or worthy of a friend.
The adjective <i>friendly</i> does not reach the full significance of the
nouns "friend" and "friendship;" one may be <i>friendly</i> to those
who are not his friends, and to be in <i>friendly</i> relations often
signifies little more than not to be hostile. In its application to
persons, <i>accessible</i> is used of public and eminent persons, who
might, if disposed, hold themselves at a distance from others.
<i>Companionable</i> and <i>sociable</i> refer to manner and behavior, <i>cordial</i>
and <i>genial</i> express genuine kindliness of heart. We speak of a
<i>cordial</i> greeting, a <i>favorable</i> reception, a <i>neighborly</i> call, a <i>sociable</i>
visitor, an <i>amicable</i> settlement, a <i>kind</i> interest, a <i>friendly</i>
regard, a <i>hearty</i> welcome. The Saxon <i>friendly</i> is stronger than
the Latin <i>amicable</i>; the <i>amicable</i> may be merely formal; the
<i>friendly</i> is from the heart. <i>Fond</i> is commonly applied to an<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
affection that becomes, or at least appears, excessive. <i>Affectionate</i>,
<i>devoted</i>, and <i>tender</i> are almost always used in a high and good
sense; as, an <i>affectionate</i> son; a <i>devoted</i> friend; "the <i>tender</i>
mercy of our God," <i>Luke</i> i, 78. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#FRIENDSHIP">FRIENDSHIP</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Friendship</i> is a deep, quiet, enduring <i>affection</i>, founded upon
mutual respect and <i>esteem</i>. <i>Friendship</i> is always mutual; there
may be unreciprocated <i>affection</i> or <i>attachment</i>, unrequited <i>love</i>,
or even unrecognized and unappreciated <i>devotion</i>, but never unreciprocated
or unrequited <i>friendship</i>; one may have friendly
feelings toward an enemy, but while there is hostility or coldness
on one side there can not be <i>friendship</i> between the two. <i>Friendliness</i>
is a quality of friendly feeling, without the deep and settled
<i>attachment</i> implied in the state of <i>friendship</i>. <i>Comity</i> is mutual
kindly courtesy, with care of each other's right, and <i>amity</i> a
friendly feeling and relation, not necessarily implying special
<i>friendliness</i>; as, the <i>comity</i> of nations, or <i>amity</i> between neighboring
countries. <i>Affection</i> may be purely natural; <i>friendship</i>
is a growth. <i>Friendship</i> is more intellectual and less emotional
than <i>love</i>; it is easier to give reasons for <i>friendship</i> than for
<i>love</i>; <i>friendship</i> is more calm and quiet, <i>love</i> more fervent; <i>love</i>
often rises to intensest passion; we can not speak of the passion
of <i>friendship</i>. <i>Friendship</i> implies some degree of equality, while
<i>love</i> does not; we can speak of man's <i>love</i> toward God, not of his
<i>friendship</i> for God. (There is more latitude in the use of the
concrete noun <i>friend</i>; Abraham was called "the friend of
God;" Christ was called "the friend of sinners.") Compare

As regards giving, <i>generous</i> refers rather to the self-sacrificing
heartiness of the giver, <i>liberal</i> to the amount of the gift; a child
may show himself <i>generous</i> in the gift of an apple, a millionaire
makes a <i>liberal</i> donation; a <i>generous</i> gift, however, is commonly
thought of as both ample and hearty. A <i>munificent</i> gift is vast
in amount, whatever the motive of its bestowal. One may be
<i>free</i> with another's money; he can be <i>generous</i> only with his
own. <i>Disinterested</i> suggests rather the thought of one's own
self-denial; <i>generous</i>, of one's hearty interest in another's welfare
or happiness. One is <i>magnanimous</i> by a greatness of soul
(L. <i>magnus</i>, great, and <i>animus</i>, soul) that rises above all that is
poor, mean, or weak, especially above every petty or ignoble
motive or feeling pertaining to one's self, and thus above resentment<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>

contest, with a suggestion of chance or hazard; in popular language,

at law, but in legal phrase he is said to <i>gain</i> his suit, case, or cause.
In <i>receiving</i>, one is strictly passive; he may <i>get</i> an estate by his

<p>A <i>gift</i> is in the popular, and also in the legal sense that which
is voluntarily bestowed without expectation of return or compensation.
<i>Gift</i> is now almost always used in the good sense, <i>bribe</i>
always in the evil sense to signify payment for a dishonorable
service under the semblance of a <i>gift</i>. In Scriptural language
<i>gift</i> is often used for <i>bribe</i>. "The king by judgment establisheth
the land; but he that receiveth <i>gifts</i> overthroweth it." <i>Prov.</i>
xxix, 4. A <i>benefaction</i> is a charitable <i>gift</i>, generally of large
amount, and viewed as of enduring value, as an endowment for a
college. A <i>donation</i> is something, perhaps of great, never of trivial
value, given usually on some public ground, as to a cause or to a
person representing a cause, but not necessarily of value beyond
the immediate present; as, a <i>donation</i> to a pastor. A <i>gratuity</i> is
usually something of moderate value and is always given as to an
inferior, and as of favor, not of right; as, a <i>gratuity</i> to a waiter.
<i>Largess</i> is archaic for a bountiful <i>gratuity</i>, usually to be distributed
among many, as among the heralds at ancient tournaments.
A <i>present</i> is a <i>gift</i> of friendship, or conciliation, and given as
to an equal or a superior; no one's pride is hurt by accepting
what is viewed as strictly a <i>present</i>. A <i>boon</i> is a <i>gift</i> that has<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
been desired or craved or perhaps asked, or something freely given
that meets some great desire. A <i>grant</i> is commonly considerable
in amount and given by public authority; as, a <i>grant</i> of public
lands for a college.</p>

<p>To <i>give</i> is primarily to transfer to another's possession or ownership
without compensation; in its secondary sense in popular use,
it is to put into another's possession by any means and on any
terms whatever; a buyer may say "<i>Give</i> me the goods, and I
will <i>give</i> you the money;" we speak of <i>giving</i> answers, information,
etc., and often of <i>giving</i> what is not agreeable to the recipient,
as blows, medicine, reproof; but when there is nothing in the
context to indicate the contrary, <i>give</i> is always understood in its
primary sense; as, this book was <i>given</i> me. <i>Give</i> thus becomes,
like <i>get</i>, a term of such general import as to be a synonym for a
wide variety of words. To <i>grant</i> is to put into one's possession in
some formal way, or by authoritative act; as, Congress <i>grants</i> lands
to a railroad corporation. To speak of <i>granting</i> a favor carries a
claim or concession of superiority on the part of the one by whom
the <i>grant</i> may be made; to <i>confer</i> has a similar sense; as, to <i>confer</i>
a degree or an honor; we <i>grant</i> a request or petition, but do
not <i>confer</i> it. To <i>impart</i> is to <i>give</i> of that which one still, to a
greater or less degree, retains; the teacher <i>imparts</i> instruction.
To <i>bestow</i> is to <i>give</i> that of which the receiver stands in especial
need; we <i>bestow</i> alms.</p>

<h4>Prepositions:</h4>

<p>We give money <i>to</i> a person <i>for</i> a thing, <i>for</i> a purpose, etc. (or
without proposition, <i>give</i> a person a sum of money); we give a
thing <i>to</i> or <i>into</i> one's care or keeping; the weary fugitive gave
himself up <i>to</i> his pursuers.</p>

<h3>GOVERN.</h3>

<h4>Synonyms:</h4>

<table class="tbs" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>command,</td><td>curb,</td><td>influence,</td><td>mold,</td><td>reign over,</td><td>rule,</td></tr>
<tr><td>control,</td><td>direct,</td><td>manage,</td><td>reign,</td><td>restrain,</td><td>sway.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Govern</i> carries the idea of authoritative administration or some
exercise of authority that is at once effective and continuous; <i>control</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
is effective, but may be momentary or occasional. One <i>controls</i>
what he holds or can hold at will absolutely in check; as, a
skilful horseman <i>controls</i> a spirited horse; a person <i>controls</i> his
temper; we say to one who is excited, "<i>control</i> yourself." A person
<i>commands</i> another when he has, or claims, the right to make
that other do his will, with power of inflicting penalty if not
obeyed; he <i>controls</i> another whom he can effectually prevent from
doing anything contrary to his will; he <i>governs</i> one whom he
actually does cause, regularly or constantly, to obey his will; a
parent may <i>command</i> a child whom he can not <i>govern</i> or <i>control</i>.
The best teachers are not greatly prone to <i>command</i>, but <i>govern</i>
or <i>control</i> their pupils largely by other means. <i>Command</i> is,
however, often used in the sense of securing, as well as requiring,
submission or obedience, as when we speak of a <i>commanding</i> influence;
a man <i>commands</i> the situation when he can shape
events as he pleases; a fortress <i>commands</i> the region when no
enemy can pass against its resistance. <i>Govern</i> implies the exercise
of knowledge and judgment as well as power. To <i>rule</i> is
more absolute and autocratic than to <i>govern</i>; to <i>sway</i> is to move
by quiet but effectual influence; to <i>mold</i> is not only to influence
feeling and action, but to shape character; to <i>manage</i> is
to secure by skilful contrivance the doing of one's will by those
whom one can not directly <i>control</i>; a wise mother, by gentle
means, <i>sways</i> the feelings and <i>molds</i> the lives of her children;
to be able to <i>manage</i> servants is an important element of good
housekeeping. The word <i>reign</i>, once so absolute, now simply denotes
that one holds the official station of sovereign in a monarchy,
with or without effective power; the Queen of England
<i>reigns</i>; the Czar of Russia both <i>reigns</i> and <i>rules</i>.</p>

<h3>GRACEFUL.</h3>

<h4>Synonym:</h4>

<table class="tbs" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>beautiful.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>That which is <i>graceful</i> is marked by elegance and harmony,
with ease of action, attitude, or posture, or delicacy of form.
<i>Graceful</i> commonly suggests motion or the possibility of motion;
<i>beautiful</i> may apply to absolute fixity; a landscape or a blue sky
is <i>beautiful</i>, but neither is <i>graceful</i>. <i>Graceful</i> commonly applies<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
to beauty as addressed to the eye, tho we often speak of a <i>graceful</i>
poem or a <i>graceful</i> compliment. <i>Graceful</i> applies to the perfection
of motion, especially of the lighter motions, which convey no
suggestion of stress or strain, and are in harmonious curves.
Apart from the thought of motion, <i>graceful</i> denotes a pleasing
harmony of outline, proportion, etc., with a certain degree of delicacy;
a Hercules is massive, an Apollo is <i>graceful</i>. We speak of
a <i>graceful</i> attitude, <i>graceful</i> drapery. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#BEAUTIFUL">BEAUTIFUL</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#BECOMING">BECOMING</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Grief</i> is acute mental pain resulting from loss, misfortune, or
deep disappointment. <i>Grief</i> is more acute and less enduring than
<i>sorrow</i>. <i>Sorrow</i> and <i>grief</i> are for definite cause; <i>sadness</i> and
<i>melancholy</i> may arise from a vague sense of want or loss, from a
low state of health, or other ill-defined cause; <i>sadness</i> may be
momentary; <i>melancholy</i> is more enduring, and may become
chronic. <i>Affliction</i> expresses a deep heart-sorrow and is applied
also to the misfortune producing such <i>sorrow</i>; <i>mourning</i> most
frequently denotes sorrow publicly expressed, or the public expression
of such <i>sorrow</i> as may reasonably be expected; as, it is
common to observe thirty days of <i>mourning</i> on the death of an
officer of state.</p>

</table>

<p><i>Habit</i> is a tendency or inclination toward an action or condition,
which by repetition has become easy, spontaneous, or even
unconscious, or an action or regular series of actions, or a condition
so induced. <i>Custom</i> is the uniform doing of the same act<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
in the same circumstance for a definite reason; <i>routine</i> is the doing
of customary acts in a regular and uniform sequence and is more
mechanical than <i>custom</i>. It is the <i>custom</i> of tradesmen to open
at a uniform hour, and to follow a regular <i>routine</i> of business
until closing-time. <i>Habit</i> always includes an involuntary tendency,
natural or acquired, greatly strengthened by frequent
repetition of the act, and may be uncontrollable, or even unconscious.
<i>Habitude</i> is habitual relation or association. <i>Custom</i> is
chiefly used of the action of many; <i>habit</i> of the action of one;
we speak of the <i>customs</i> of society, the <i>habits</i> of an individual.
<i>Fashion</i> is the generally recognized <i>custom</i> in the smaller matters,
especially in dress. A <i>rule</i> is prescribed either by some external
authority or by one's own will; as, it is the <i>rule</i> of the house; or,
I make it my invariable <i>rule</i>. <i>System</i> is the coordination of many
acts or things into a unity, and is more and better than <i>routine</i>.
<i>Use</i> and <i>usage</i> denote the manner of using something; we speak
of one person's <i>use</i> of language, but of the <i>usage</i> of many; a <i>use</i>
or <i>usage</i> is almost always a <i>habit</i>. <i>Practise</i> is the active doing of
something in a systematic way; we do not speak of the <i>practise</i>,
but of the <i>habit</i> of going to sleep; we speak of a tradesman's <i>custom</i>,
a lawyer's or a physician's <i>practise</i>. Educationally, <i>practise</i>
is the voluntary and persistent attempt to make skill a <i>habit</i>; as,
<i>practise</i> in penmanship. <i>Wont</i> is blind and instinctive <i>habit</i> like
that which attaches an animal to a locality: the word is now
almost wholly poetic. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#DRESS">DRESS</a></span>.</p>

disease upon another, etc. ["Transpire," in the sense of <i>happen</i>,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>

</table>

<p><i>Gratification</i> is the giving any mental or physical desire something
that it craves; <i>satisfaction</i> is the giving such a desire all
that it craves. <i>Happiness</i> is the positively agreeable experience
that springs from the possession of good, the <i>gratification</i> or <i>satisfaction</i>
of the desires or the relief from pain and evil. <i>Comfort</i>
may be almost wholly negative, being found in security or relief
from that which pains or annoys; there is <i>comfort</i> by a warm
fireside on a wintry night; the sympathy of a true friend affords
<i>comfort</i> in sorrow. <i>Enjoyment</i> is more positive, always implying
something to be definitely and consciously delighted in; a sick
person finds <i>comfort</i> in relief from pain, while he may be far from
a state of <i>enjoyment</i>. <i>Pleasure</i> is still more vivid, being an arousing
of the faculties to an intensely agreeable activity; <i>satisfaction</i>
is more tranquil than <i>pleasure</i>, being the agreeable consciousness
of having all that our faculties demand or crave; when a worthy
<i>pleasure</i> is past, a worthy <i>satisfaction</i> remains. As referring to a
mental state, <i>gratification</i> is used to denote a mild form of <i>happiness</i>
resulting from some incident not of very great importance;
<i>satisfaction</i> should properly express a <i>happiness</i> deeper, more
complete, and more abiding; but as intellect or sensibilities of a
low order may find <i>satisfaction</i> in that which is very poor or unworthy,
the word has come to be feeble and tame in ordinary use.
<i>Happiness</i> is more positive than <i>comfort</i>, <i>enjoyment</i>, or <i>satisfaction</i>,
more serene and rational than <i>pleasure</i>; <i>pleasure</i> is of necessity
transient; <i>happiness</i> is abiding, and may be eternal;
thus, we speak of <i>pleasures</i>, but the plural of <i>happiness</i> is scarcely
used. <i>Happiness</i>, in the full sense, is mental or spiritual or both,
and is viewed as resulting from some worthy <i>gratification</i> or <i>satisfaction</i>;
we may speak of a brute as experiencing <i>comfort</i> or
<i>pleasure</i>, but scarcely as in possession of <i>happiness</i>; we speak of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
vicious <i>pleasure</i>, <i>delight</i>, or <i>joy</i>, but not of vicious <i>happiness</i>.
<i>Felicity</i> is a philosophical term, colder and more formal than <i>happiness</i>.
<i>Gladness</i> is <i>happiness</i> that overflows, expressing itself in
countenance, voice, manner, and action. <i>Joy</i> is more intense than
<i>happiness</i>, deeper than <i>gladness</i>, to which it is akin, nobler and
more enduring than <i>pleasure</i>. <i>Gaiety</i> is more superficial than
<i>joy</i>, more demonstrative than <i>gladness</i>. <i>Rejoicing</i> is <i>happiness</i> or
<i>joy</i> that finds utterance in word, song, festivity, etc. <i>Delight</i> is
vivid, overflowing <i>happiness</i> of a somewhat transient kind; <i>ecstasy</i>
is a state of extreme or extravagant <i>delight</i> so that the one
affected by it seems almost beside himself with <i>joy</i>; <i>rapture</i> is
closely allied to <i>ecstasy</i>, but is more serene, exalted, and enduring.
<i>Triumph</i> is such <i>joy</i> as results from victory, success, achievement.
<i>Blessedness</i> is at once the state and the sense of being divinely
blessed; as, the <i>blessedness</i> of the righteous. <i>Bliss</i> is ecstatic, perfected
<i>happiness</i>; as, the <i>bliss</i> of heaven. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#COMFORT">COMFORT</a></span>.</p>

<div class="bq1"><p>And grasps the skirts of <i>happy</i> chance.</p>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smc">Tennyson</span> <i>In Memoriam</i> lxiii, st. 2.</p></div>

<p class="noin">In this sense <i>happy</i> is closely allied to <i>fortunate</i> and <i>lucky</i>. (See
<span class="smcl"><a href="#FORTUNATE">FORTUNATE</a></span>.) <i>Happy</i> has, however, so far diverged from this original
sense as to apply to advantages where chance is not recognized,
or is even excluded by direct reference to the divine will, when it
becomes almost equivalent to <i>blessed</i>.</p>

<div class="bq1"><p>Behold, <i>happy</i> is the man whom God correcteth.</p>

<p class="tdr"><i>Job</i> v, 17.</p></div>

<p class="noin"><i>Happy</i> is also applied to the ready dexterity or skill by which
favorable results (usually in minor matters) are secured, when it
becomes a synonym for <i>dexterous</i>, <i>felicitous</i>, and the associated
words; as, he has a <i>happy</i> wit; <i>happy</i> at retort (compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#CLEVER">CLEVER</a></span>).
In its most frequent present use, <i>happy</i> is applied to the state of
one enjoying happiness, or to that by which happiness is expressed;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
as, a <i>happy</i> heart; a <i>happy</i> face; <i>happy</i> laughter; <i>happy</i> tears
(compare synonyms for <span class="smcl"><a href="#HAPPINESS">HAPPINESS</a></span>). <i>Cheerful</i> applies to the possession
or expression of a moderate and tranquil happiness. A
<i>cheery</i> word spontaneously gives cheer to others; a <i>cheering</i> word
is more distinctly planned to cheer and encourage. <i>Gay</i> applies
to an effusive and superficial happiness (often not really worthy of
that name) perhaps resulting largely from abundant animal spirits:
we speak of <i>gay</i> revelers or a <i>gay</i> horse. A <i>buoyant</i> spirit is, as
it were, borne up by joy and hope. A <i>sunny</i> disposition has a constant
tranquil brightness that irradiates all who come within its
influence.</p>

</table>

<p><i>Harvest</i>, from the Anglo-Saxon, signified originally "autumn,"
and as that is the usual season of gathering ripened <i>crops</i> in Northern
lands, the word came to its present meaning of the season of
gathering ripened grain or <i>fruits</i>, whether summer or autumn,
and hence a <i>crop</i> gathered or ready for gathering; also, the act
or process of gathering a <i>crop</i> or <i>crops</i>. "The <i>harvest</i> truly is
great, but the laborers are few," <i>Luke</i> x, 2. "Lift up your eyes
and look on the fields, for they are white already to <i>harvest</i>,"
<i>John</i> iv, 35. <i>Harvest</i> is the elegant and literary word; <i>crop</i> is
the common and commercial expression; we say a man sells his
<i>crop</i>, but we should not speak of his selling his <i>harvest</i>; we speak
of an ample or abundant <i>harvest</i>, a good <i>crop</i>. <i>Harvest</i> is applied
almost wholly to grain; <i>crop</i> applies to almost anything that is
gathered in; we speak of the potato-<i>crop</i>, not the potato-<i>harvest</i>;
we may say either the wheat-<i>crop</i> or the wheat-<i>harvest</i>. <i>Produce</i>
is a collective word for all that is produced in farming or gardening,
and is, in modern usage, almost wholly restricted to this sense;
we speak of <i>produce</i> collectively, but of a <i>product</i> or various <i>products</i>;
vegetables, <i>fruits</i>, eggs, butter, etc., may be termed farm-<i>produce</i>,
or the <i>products</i> of the farm. <i>Product</i> is a word of wider
application than <i>produce</i>; we speak of the <i>products</i> of manufacturing,
the <i>products</i> of thought, or the <i>product</i> obtained by multiplying
one number by another. The word <i>proceeds</i> is chiefly
used of the <i>return</i> from an investment: we speak of the <i>produce</i>
of a farm, but of the <i>proceeds</i> of the money invested in farming.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
The <i>yield</i> is what the land gives up to the farmer's demand; we
speak of the <i>return</i> from an expenditure of money or labor, but
of the <i>yield</i> of corn or oats. <i>Harvest</i> has also a figurative use,
such as <i>crop</i> more rarely permits; we term a religious revival a
<i>harvest</i> of souls; the <i>result</i> of lax enforcement of law is a <i>harvest</i>
of crime. As regards time, <i>harvest</i>, <i>harvest-tide</i>, and <i>harvest-time</i>
alike denote the period or season when the crops are or should
be gathered (<i>tide</i> being simply the old Saxon word for <i>time</i>). <i>Harvest-home</i>
ordinarily denotes the <i>festival</i> of <i>harvest</i>, and when
used to denote simply the season always gives a suggestion of festivity
and rejoicing, such as <i>harvest</i> and <i>harvest-time</i> by themselves
do not express.</p>

<p><i>Repugnance</i> applies to that which one feels himself summoned
or impelled to do or to endure, and from which he instinctively
draws back. <i>Aversion</i> is the turning away of the mind or feelings
from some person or thing, or from some course of action,
etc. <i>Hate</i>, or <i>hatred</i>, as applied to persons, is intense and continued
<i>aversion</i>, usually with disposition to injure; <i>anger</i> is sudden
and brief, <i>hatred</i> is lingering and enduring; "Her wrath became
a <i>hate</i>," <span class="smc">Tennyson</span> <i>Pelleas and Ettarre</i> st. 16. As applied
to things, <i>hatred</i> is intense <i>aversion</i>, with desire to destroy or remove;
<i>hatred</i> of evil is a righteous passion, akin to <i>abhorrence</i>,
but more vehement. <i>Malice</i> involves the active intent to injure;
in the legal sense, <i>malice</i> is the intent to injure, even tho with
no personal <i>ill will</i>; as, a highwayman would be said to entertain
<i>malice</i> toward the unknown traveler whom he attacks. <i>Malice</i> is
direct, pressing toward a result; <i>malignity</i> is deep, lingering, and
venomous, tho often impotent to act; <i>rancor</i> (akin to <i>rancid</i>)
is cherished <i>malignity</i> that has soured and festered and is virulent
and implacable. <i>Spite</i> is petty <i>malice</i> that delights to inflict stinging
pain; <i>grudge</i> is deeper than <i>spite</i>; it is sinister and bitter;
<i>grudge</i>, <i>resentment</i>, and <i>revenge</i> are all retaliatory, <i>grudge</i> being
the disposition, <i>revenge</i> the determination to repay real or supposed
offense with injury; <i>revenge</i> may denote also the retaliatory act;
<i>resentment</i>, the best word of the three, always holds itself to be<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
justifiable, but looks less certainly to action than <i>grudge</i> or <i>revenge</i>.
Simple goodness may arouse the <i>hatred</i> of the wicked; they will
be moved to <i>revenge</i> only by what they deem an injury or affront.

a fortune or an opinion, a friend or an enemy; he <i>has</i> time,

borrowed, what has been entrusted to him, or what he has stolen.
To <i>possess</i> a thing is to <i>have</i> the ownership with control and enjoyment
of it. To <i>hold</i> is to <i>have</i> in one's hand, or securely in
one's control; a man <i>holds</i> his friend's coat for a moment, or he
<i>holds</i> a struggling horse; he <i>holds</i> a promissory note, or <i>holds</i> an
office. To <i>own</i> is to <i>have</i> the right of property in; to <i>possess</i> is to
<i>have</i> that right in actual exercise; to <i>occupy</i> is to <i>have</i> possession
and use, with some degree of permanency, with or without ownership.
A man <i>occupies</i> his own house or a room in a hotel; a
man may <i>own</i> a farm of which he is not in possession because a
tenant <i>occupies</i> it and is determined to <i>hold</i> it; the proprietor <i>owns</i>
the property, but the tenant <i>is in possession</i>. To <i>be in possession</i>
differs from <i>possess</i> in that to <i>possess</i> denotes both right and
fact, while to <i>be in possession</i> denotes simply the fact with no
affirmation as to the right. To <i>have</i> reason is to be endowed
with the faculty; to <i>be in possession of</i> one's reason denotes that
the faculty is in actual present exercise.</p>

<p><i>Hazard</i> is the incurring the possibility of loss or harm for the

In <i>hazard</i> the possibilities of gain or loss are nearly balanced;
in <i>risk</i> the possibility of loss is the chief thought; the foolhardy
take great <i>risks</i> in mere wantonness; in <i>chance</i> and <i>venture</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the hope of good predominates; we speak of a merchant's <i>venture</i>,

to run a <i>risk</i>; he freely seeks a <i>venture</i>; we speak of
the <i>chance</i> of winning, the <i>hazard</i> or <i>risk</i> of losing. <i>Accidents</i>
are incalculable; <i>casualties</i> may be to a certain extent anticipated;
death and wounds are <i>casualties</i> of battle, certain to happen
to some, but uncertain as to whom or how many. A <i>contingency</i>

<i>Healthful</i> signifies promotive of health, tending or adapted to confer,
preserve, or promote health; as, a <i>healthful</i> climate. <i>Wholesome</i>
food in a <i>healthful</i> climate makes a <i>healthy</i> man. With
<i>healthful</i> are ranged the words <i>hygienic</i>, <i>salubrious</i>, <i>salutary</i>, <i>sanitary</i>,
and <i>wholesome</i>, while the other words are associated with
<i>healthy</i>. <i>Salubrious</i> is always used in the physical sense, and is

<p><i>Help</i> expresses greater dependence and deeper need than <i>aid</i>.
In extremity we say "God <i>help</i> me!" rather than "God <i>aid</i> me!"
In time of danger we cry "<i>help! help!</i>" rather than "<i>aid! aid!</i>"
To <i>aid</i> is to <i>second</i> another's own exertions. We can speak of
<i>helping</i> the helpless, but not of <i>aiding</i> them. <i>Help</i> includes <i>aid</i>,
but <i>aid</i> may fall short of the meaning of <i>help</i>. In law to <i>aid</i> or

To <i>cooperate</i> is to <i>aid</i> as an equal; to <i>assist</i> implies a subordinate
and secondary relation. One <i>assists</i> a fallen friend to rise; he <i>cooperates</i>
with him in helping others. <i>Encourage</i> refers to mental
<i>aid</i>, as <i>uphold</i> now usually does; <i>succor</i> and <i>support</i>, oftenest
to material assistance. We <i>encourage</i> the timid or despondent,

<h3>HERETIC.</h3>

<h4>Synonyms:</h4>

<table class="tbs" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>dissenter,</td><td>heresiarch,</td><td>non-conformist,</td><td>schismatic.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Etymologically, a <i>heretic</i> is one who takes or chooses his own
belief, instead of the belief of his church; hence, a <i>heretic</i> is one
who denies commonly accepted views, or who holds opinions contrary
to the recognized standard or tenets of any established religious,
philosophical, or other system, school, or party; the religious
sense of the word is the predominant one; a <i>schismatic</i> is
primarily one who produces a split or rent in the church. A <i>heretic</i>
differs in doctrine from the religious body with which he is connected;
a <i>schismatic</i> differs in doctrine or practise, or in both. A
<i>heretic</i> may be reticent, or even silent; a <i>schismatic</i> introduces
divisions. A <i>heresiarch</i> is the author of a heresy or the leader of
a heretical party, and is thus at once a <i>heretic</i> and a <i>schismatic</i>.
With advancing ideas of religious liberty, the odious sense once
attached to these words is largely modified, and <i>heretic</i> is often
used playfully. <i>Dissenter</i> and <i>non-conformist</i> are terms specifically
applied to English subjects who hold themselves aloof from
the Church of England; the former term is extended to non-adherents
of the established church in some other countries, as
Russia.</p>

<p>Substances quite <i>unlike</i> are <i>heterogeneous</i> as regards each other.
A <i>heterogeneous</i> mixture is one whose constituents are not only<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>

substances such as lime, sand, and clay, which are <i>heterogeneous</i>
as regards each other, but the cement is said to be homogeneous
if the different constituents are evenly mixed throughout, so that
any one portion of the mixture is exactly like any other. A substance
may fail of being homogeneous and yet not be <i>heterogeneous</i>,
in which case it is said to be <i>non-homogeneous</i> or <i>unhomogeneous</i>;
a bar of iron that contains flaws, air-bubbles, etc., or for
any other reason is not of uniform structure and density throughout,
tho no foreign substance be mixed with the iron, is said
to be <i>non-homogeneous</i>. A <i>miscellaneous</i> mixture may or may
not be <i>heterogeneous</i>; if the objects are alike in kind, but different
in size, form, quality, use, etc., and without special order or relation,
the collection is <i>miscellaneous</i>; if the objects differ in kind,

</table>

<p><i>Hide</i> is the general term, including all the rest, signifying to
put out of sight or beyond ready observation or approach; a
thing may be <i>hidden</i> by intention, by accident, or by the imperfection
of the faculties of the one from whom it is <i>hidden</i>;
in their games, children <i>hide</i> the slipper, or <i>hide</i> themselves from
each other; a man unconsciously <i>hides</i> a picture from another by
standing before it, or <i>hides</i> a thing from himself by laying something
else over it. Even an unconscious object may <i>hide</i> another;
as, a cloud <i>hides</i> the sun, or a building <i>hides</i> some part of the
prospect by intervening between it and the observer's position.
As an act of persons, to <i>conceal</i> is always intentional; one may
<i>hide</i> his face in anger, grief, or abstraction; he <i>conceals</i> his face
when he fears recognition. A house is <i>hidden</i> by foliage; the
bird's nest is artfully <i>concealed</i>. <i>Secrete</i> is a stronger word than
<i>conceal</i>, and is used chiefly of such material objects as may be
separated from the person, or from their ordinary surroundings,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
and put in unlooked-for places; a man <i>conceals</i> a scar on his face,
but does not <i>secrete</i> it; a thief <i>secretes</i> stolen goods; an officer
may also be said to <i>secrete</i> himself to watch the thief. A thing is
<i>covered</i> by putting something over or around it, whether by accident
or design; it is <i>screened</i> by putting something before it,
always with some purpose of protection from observation, inconvenience,
attack, censure, etc. In the figurative use, a person
may <i>hide</i> honorable feelings; he <i>conceals</i> an evil or hostile intent.
Anything which is effectually <i>covered</i> and <i>hidden</i> under any
mass or accumulation is <i>buried</i>. Money is <i>buried</i> in the ground;
a body is <i>buried</i> in the sea; a paper is <i>buried</i> under other documents.
Whatever is <i>buried</i> is <i>hidden</i> or <i>concealed</i>; but there
are many ways of <i>hiding</i> or <i>concealing</i> a thing without <i>burying</i>
it. So a person may be <i>covered</i> with wraps, and not <i>buried</i> under
them. <i>Bury</i> may be used of any object, <i>entomb</i> and <i>inter</i> only of
a dead body. Figuratively, one may be said to be <i>buried</i> in business,
in study, etc. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#IMMERSE">IMMERSE</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#PALLIATE">PALLIATE</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Deep</i>, while an antonym of <i>high</i> in usage, may apply to the
very same distance simply measured in an opposite direction, <i>high</i>
applying to vertical distance measured from below upward, and
<i>deep</i> to vertical distance measured from above downward; as, a
<i>deep</i> valley nestling between <i>high</i> mountains. <i>High</i> is a relative
term signifying greatly raised above any object, base, or surface,
in comparison with what is usual, or with some standard; a table
is <i>high</i> if it exceeds thirty inches; a hill is not <i>high</i> at a hundred
feet. That is <i>tall</i> whose height is greatly in excess of its breadth
or diameter, and whose actual height is great for an object of its
kind; as, a <i>tall</i> tree; a <i>tall</i> man; <i>tall</i> grass. That is <i>lofty</i> which
is imposing or majestic in height; we term a spire <i>tall</i> with reference
to its altitude, or <i>lofty</i> with reference to its majestic appearance.
That is <i>elevated</i> which is raised somewhat above its surroundings;
that is <i>eminent</i> which is far above them; as, an <i>elevated</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
platform; an <i>eminent</i> promontory. In the figurative sense, <i>elevated</i>
is less than <i>eminent</i>, and this less than <i>exalted</i>; we speak of <i>high</i>,
<i>lofty</i>, or <i>elevated</i> thoughts, aims, etc., in the good sense, but sometimes
of <i>high</i> feelings, looks, words, etc., in the invidious sense
of haughty or arrogant. A <i>high</i> ambition may be merely selfish;
a <i>lofty</i> ambition is worthy and <i>noble</i>. <i>Towering</i>, in the literal
sense compares with <i>lofty</i> and majestic; but in the figurative
sense, its use is almost always invidious; as, a <i>towering</i> passion;
a <i>towering</i> ambition disregards and crushes all opposing considerations,
however rational, lovely, or holy. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#STEEP">STEEP</a></span>.</p>

<p>To <i>hinder</i> is to keep from action, progress, motion, or growth,
or to make such action, progress, motion, or growth later in beginning
or completion than it would otherwise have been. An
action is <i>prevented</i> by anything that comes in before it to make it
impossible; it is <i>hindered</i> by anything that keeps it from either
beginning or ending so soon as it otherwise would, or as expected
or intended. It is more common, however, to say that the start is
<i>delayed</i>, the progress <i>hindered</i>. An action that is <i>hindered</i> does
not take place at the appointed or appropriate time; that which is
<i>prevented</i> does not take place at all; to <i>hinder</i> a thing long enough
may amount to <i>preventing</i> it. A railroad-train may be <i>hindered</i>
by a snow-storm from arriving on time; it may by special order
be <i>prevented</i> from starting. To <i>retard</i> is simply to make slow by
any means whatever. To <i>obstruct</i> is to <i>hinder</i>, or possibly to <i>prevent</i>
advance or passage by putting something in the way; to <i>oppose</i>
or <i>resist</i> is to <i>hinder</i>, or possibly to <i>prevent</i> by directly contrary
or hostile action, <i>resist</i> being the stronger term and having
more suggestion of physical force; <i>obstructed</i> roads <i>hinder</i> the
march of an enemy, tho there may be no force strong enough to
<i>oppose</i> it; one <i>opposes</i> a measure, a motion, an amendment, or
the like; it is a criminal offense to <i>resist</i> an officer in the discharge

<p><i>History</i> is a systematic record of past events. <i>Annals</i> and
<i>chronicles</i> relate events with little regard to their relative importance,
and with complete subserviency to their succession in time.
<i>Annals</i> are yearly records; <i>chronicles</i> follow the order of time.
Both necessarily lack emphasis, selection, and perspective. <i>Archives</i>
are public <i>records</i>, which may be <i>annals</i>, or <i>chronicles</i>, or
deeds of property, etc. <i>Memoirs</i> generally record the lives of individuals
or facts pertaining to individual lives. A <i>biography</i> is
distinctively a written <i>account</i> of one person's life and actions; an
<i>autobiography</i> is a <i>biography</i> written by the person whose life it
records. <i>Annals</i>, <i>archives</i>, <i>chronicles</i>, <i>biographies</i>, and <i>memoirs</i>
and other <i>records</i> furnish the materials of <i>history</i>. <i>History</i> recounts
events with careful attention to their importance, their
mutual relations, their causes and consequences, selecting and
grouping events on the ground of interest or importance. <i>History</i>
is usually applied to such an <i>account</i> of events affecting communities
and nations, tho sometimes we speak of the <i>history</i> of a

<p><i>Sacred</i> is applied to that which is to be regarded as inviolable
on any account, and so is not restricted to divine things; therefore
in its lower applications it is less than <i>holy</i>. That which is <i>sacred</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
may be made so by institution, decree, or association; that which
is <i>holy</i> is so by its own nature, possessing intrinsic moral purity,
and, in the highest sense, absolute moral perfection. God is <i>holy</i>;
his commands are <i>sacred</i>. <i>Holy</i> may be applied also to that which
is <i>hallowed</i>; as, "the place whereon thou standest is <i>holy</i> ground,"
<i>Ex.</i> iii, 5. In such use <i>holy</i> is more than <i>sacred</i>, as if the very
qualities of a spiritual or divine presence were imparted to the
place or object. <i>Divine</i> has been used with great looseness, as
applying to anything eminent or admirable, in the line either of
goodness or of mere power, as to eloquence, music, etc., but there
is a commendable tendency to restrict the word to its higher
sense, as designating that which belongs to or is worthy of the

<p><i>Abode</i>, <i>dwelling</i>, and <i>habitation</i> are used with little difference
of meaning to denote the place where one habitually lives; <i>abode</i>
and <i>habitation</i> belong to the poetic or elevated style. Even
<i>dwelling</i> is not used in familiar speech; a person says "my
<i>house</i>," "my <i>home</i>," or more formally "my <i>residence</i>." <i>Home</i>,
from the Anglo-Saxon, denoting originally a <i>dwelling</i>, came to
mean an endeared <i>dwelling</i> as the scene of domestic love and
happy and cherished family life, a sense to which there is an increasing
tendency to restrict the word&mdash;desirably so, since we
have other words to denote the mere dwelling-place; we say
"The wretched tenement could not be called <i>home</i>," or "The
humble cabin was dear to him as the <i>home</i> of his childhood."</p>

<p><i>Horizontal</i> signifies in the direction of or parallel to the horizon.
For practical purposes <i>level</i> and <i>horizontal</i> are identical,

which has no especially noticeable elevations or inequalities; as,
a <i>level</i> road. <i>Flat</i>, according to its derivation from the Anglo-Saxon
<i>flet</i>, a floor, applies to a surface only, and, in the first and
most usual sense, to a surface that is <i>horizontal</i> or <i>level</i> in all directions;
a line may be <i>level</i>, a floor is <i>flat</i>; <i>flat</i> is also applied in
a derived sense to any <i>plane</i> surface without irregularities or elevations,
as a picture may be painted on the <i>flat</i> surface of a perpendicular
wall. <i>Plane</i> applies only to a surface, and is used
with more mathematical exactness than <i>flat</i>. The adjective
<i>plain</i>, originally the same word as <i>plane</i>, is now rarely used except
in the figurative senses, but the original sense appears in the
noun, as we speak of "a wide <i>plain</i>." We speak of a <i>horizontal</i>

<p>A <i>hunt</i> may be either the act of pursuing or the act of seeking,
or a combination of the two. A <i>chase</i> or <i>pursuit</i> is after that
which is fleeing or departing; a <i>search</i> is for that which is hidden;
a <i>hunt</i> may be for that which is either hidden or fleeing; a <i>search</i>
is a minute and careful seeking, and is especially applied to a locality;
we make a <i>search</i> of or through a house, for an object, in
which connection it would be colloquial to say a <i>hunt</i>. <i>Hunt</i>
never quite loses its association with field-sports, where it includes
both <i>search</i> and <i>chase</i>; the <i>search</i> till the game is hunted
out, and the <i>chase</i> till it is hunted down. Figuratively, we speak
of literary <i>pursuits</i>, or of the <i>pursuit</i> of knowledge; a <i>search</i> for<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
reasons; the <i>chase</i> of fame or honor; <i>hunt</i>, in figurative use, inclines
to the unfavorable sense of <i>inquisition</i>, but with more of
dash and aggressiveness; as, a <i>hunt</i> for heresy.</p>

<p><i>Pretense</i> (L. <i>pr&aelig;tendo</i>) primarily signifies the holding something
forward as having certain rights or claims, whether truly or
falsely; in the good sense, it is now rarely used except with a negative;
as, there can be no <i>pretense</i> that this is due; a false <i>pretense</i>
implies the possibility of a true <i>pretense</i>; but, alone and
unlimited, <i>pretense</i> commonly signifies the offering of something
for what it is not. <i>Hypocrisy</i> is the false <i>pretense</i> of moral excellence,
either as a cover for actual wrong, or for the sake of the
credit and advantage attaching to virtue. <i>Cant</i> (L. <i>cantus</i>, a song),
primarily the singsong iteration of the language of any party,
school, or sect, denotes the mechanical and pretentious use of religious
phraseology, without corresponding feeling or character;
<i>sanctimoniousness</i> is the assumption of a saintly manner without a
saintly character. As <i>cant</i> is <i>hypocrisy</i> in utterance, so <i>sanctimoniousness</i>
is <i>hypocrisy</i> in appearance, as in looks, tones, etc. <i>Pietism</i>,
originally a word of good import, is now chiefly used for an
unregulated emotionalism; <i>formalism</i> is an exaggerated devotion
to forms, rites, and ceremonies, without corresponding earnestness
of heart; <i>sham</i> (identical in origin with <i>shame</i>) is a trick or
device that puts one to shame, or that shamefully disappoints expectation
or falsifies appearance. <i>Affectation</i> is in matters of
intellect, taste, etc., much what <i>hypocrisy</i> is in morals and religion;
<i>affectation</i> might be termed petty <i>hypocrisy</i>. Compare

<p>A <i>hypothesis</i> is a statement of what is deemed possibly true,
assumed and reasoned upon as if certainly true, with a view of
reaching truth not yet surely known; especially, in the sciences,
a <i>hypothesis</i> is a comprehensive tentative explanation of certain
phenomena, which is meant to include all other facts of the same

to bring all related facts into comparison; if the <i>hypothesis</i> explains
all the facts, it is regarded as verified; till then it is regarded
as a working <i>hypothesis</i>, that is, one that may answer for
present practical purposes. A <i>hypothesis</i> may be termed a comprehensive
<i>guess</i>. A <i>guess</i> is a swift conclusion from data directly
at hand, and held as probable or tentative, while one confessedly
lacks material for absolute certainty. A <i>conjecture</i> is more methodical
than a <i>guess</i>, while a <i>supposition</i> is still slower and more
settled; a <i>conjecture</i>, like a <i>guess</i>, is preliminary and tentative; a
<i>supposition</i> is more nearly final; a <i>surmise</i> is more floating and
visionary, and often sinister; as, a <i>surmise</i> that a stranger may
be a pickpocket. <i>Theory</i> is used of the mental coordination of
facts and principles, that may or may not prove correct; a machine
may be perfect in <i>theory</i>, but useless in fact. <i>Scheme</i> may
be used as nearly equivalent to <i>theory</i>, but is more frequently
applied to proposed action, and in the sense of a somewhat visionary
plan. A <i>speculation</i> may be wholly of the brain, resting upon<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>

<p><i>Idea</i> is in Greek a <i>form</i> or an <i>image</i>. The word signified in
early philosophical use the <i>archetype</i> or primal <i>image</i> which the
Platonic philosophy supposed to be the <i>model</i> or <i>pattern</i> that
existing objects imperfectly embody. This high sense has nearly
disappeared from the word <i>idea</i>, and has been largely appropriated
by <i>ideal</i>, tho something of the original meaning still appears
when in theological or philosophical language we speak of the <i>ideas</i>
of God. The present popular use of <i>idea</i> makes it to signify any
product of mental <i>apprehension</i> or activity, considered as an object
of knowledge or thought; this coincides with the primitive
sense at but a single point&mdash;that an <i>idea</i> is mental as opposed to
anything substantial or physical; thus, almost any mental product,
as a <i>belief</i>, <i>conception</i>, <i>design</i>, <i>opinion</i>, etc., may now be

<p>An <i>ideal</i> is that which is conceived or taken as the highest type

the primal form, actual or imaginary, according to which any existing

be the original form, but one having equal authority with that as a<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
<i>standard</i>. An <i>ideal</i> may be primal, or may be slowly developed
even from failures and by negations; an <i>ideal</i> is meant to be perfect,
not merely the thing that has been attained or is to be
attained, but the best conceivable thing that could by possibility
be attained. The artist's <i>ideal</i> is his own mental image, of which
his finished work is but an imperfect expression. The <i>original</i> is the
first specimen, good or bad; the <i>original</i> of a master is superior to
all copies. The <i>standard</i> may be below the <i>ideal</i>. The <i>ideal</i> is
imaginary, and ordinarily unattainable; the <i>standard</i> is concrete,
and ordinarily attainable, being a measure to which all else of its
kind must conform; as, the <i>standard</i> of weights and measures, of
corn, or of cotton. The <i>idea</i> of virtue is the mental concept

acts, necessarily results from <i>imbecility</i>, but may also result from
other causes, as from insanity or from age, sex, etc.; as, the <i>incapacity</i>
of a minor to make a contract. <i>Idiocy</i> or <i>imbecility</i> is
weakness of mind, while insanity is disorder or abnormal action
of mind. <i>Folly</i> and <i>foolishness</i> denote a want of mental and
often of moral balance. <i>Fatuity</i> is sometimes used as equivalent
to <i>idiocy</i>, but more frequently signifies conceited and excessive
<i>foolishness</i> or <i>folly</i>. <i>Stupidity</i> is dulness and slowness of mental

<p><i>Idle</i> in all uses rests upon its root meaning, as derived from
the Anglo-Saxon <i>idel</i>, which signifies vain, empty, useless. <i>Idle</i>
thus denotes not primarily the absence of action, but vain action&mdash;the
absence of useful, effective action; the <i>idle</i> schoolboy may
be very actively whittling his desk or tormenting his neighbors.
Doing nothing whatever is the secondary meaning of <i>idle</i>. One
may be temporarily <i>idle</i> of necessity; if he is habitually <i>idle</i>, it is
his own fault. <i>Lazy</i> signifies indisposed to exertion, averse to
labor; idleness is in fact; laziness is in disposition or inclination.
A <i>lazy</i> person may chance to be employed in useful work, but he
acts without energy or impetus. We speak figuratively of a <i>lazy</i>
stream. The <i>inert</i> person seems like dead matter (characterized
by inertia), powerless to move; the <i>sluggish</i> moves heavily and
toilsomely; the most active person may sometimes find the bodily
or mental powers <i>sluggish</i>. <i>Slothful</i> belongs in the moral realm,
denoting a self-indulgent aversion to exertion. "The <i>slothful</i>
hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to bring it again to
his mouth," <i>Prov.</i> xxvi, 15. <i>Indolent</i> is a milder term for the
same quality; the <i>slothful</i> man hates action; the <i>indolent</i> man
loves inaction. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#VAIN">VAIN</a></span>.</p>

<p>The old psychology treated of the <i>Reproductive Imagination</i>,
which simply reproduces the images that the mind has in any way
acquired, and the <i>Productive Imagination</i> which modifies and
combines mental images so as to produce what is virtually new.
To this <i>Reproductive Imagination</i> President Noah Porter and
others have given the name of <i>phantasy</i> or <i>fantasy</i> (many psychologists
preferring the former spelling). <i>Phantasy</i> or <i>fantasy</i>,
so understood, presents numerous and varied images, often combining
them into new forms with exceeding vividness, yet without
any true constructive power, but with the mind adrift, blindly
and passively following the laws of association, and with reason
and will in torpor; the mental images being perhaps as varied and
as vivid, but also as purposeless and unsystematized as the visual
images in a kaleidoscope; such <i>fantasy</i> (often loosely called <i>imagination</i>)
appears in dreaming, reverie, somnambulism, and intoxication.
<i>Fantasy</i> in ordinary usage simply denotes capricious
or erratic <i>fancy</i>, as appears in the adjective <i>fantastic</i>. <i>Imagination</i>
and <i>fancy</i> differ from <i>fantasy</i> in bringing the images and
their combinations under the control of the will; <i>imagination</i> is
the broader and higher term, including <i>fancy</i>; <i>imagination</i> is the
act or power of imaging or of reimaging objects of perception
or thought, of combining the products of knowledge in modified,
new, or ideal forms&mdash;the creative or constructive power
of the mind; while <i>fancy</i> is the act or power of forming pleasing,
graceful, whimsical, or odd mental images, or of combining
them with little regard to rational processes of construction;
<i>imagination</i> in its lower form. Both <i>fancy</i> and <i>imagination</i>
recombine and modify mental images; either may work with the
other's materials; <i>imagination</i> may glorify the tiniest flower;
<i>fancy</i> may play around a mountain or a star; the one great distinction
between them is that <i>fancy</i> is superficial, while <i>imagination</i>
is deep, essential, spiritual. Wordsworth, who was the first<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
clearly to draw the distinction between the <i>fancy</i> and the <i>imagination</i>,
states it as follows:</p>

<div class="bq1"><p>To aggregate and to associate, to evoke and to combine, belong as well to the
<i>imagination</i> as to the <i>fancy</i>; but either the materials evoked and combined are different;
or they are brought together under a different law, and for a different purpose.
<i>Fancy</i> does not require that the materials which she makes use of should be
susceptible of changes in their constitution from her touch; and where they admit of
modification, it is enough for her purpose if it be slight, limited, and evanescent.
Directly the reverse of these are the desires and demands of the <i>imagination</i>. She
recoils from everything but the plastic, the pliant, and the indefinite. She leaves it
to <i>fancy</i> to describe Queen Mab as coming:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;">
<span class="i0">'In shape no bigger than an agate stone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On the forefinger of an alderman.'<br /></span>
</div>

<p>Having to speak of stature, she does not tell you that her gigantic angel was as tall
as Pompey's Pillar; much less that he was twelve cubits or twelve hundred cubits
high; or that his dimensions equalled those of Teneriffe or Atlas; because these, and
if they were a million times as high, it would be the same, are bounded. The expression
is, 'His stature reached the sky!' the illimitable firmament!&mdash;When the <i>imagination</i>
frames a comparison, ... a sense of the truth of the likeness from the
moment that it is perceived grows&mdash;and continues to grow&mdash;upon the mind; the resemblance
depending less upon outline of form and feature than upon expression
and effect, less upon casual and outstanding than upon inherent and internal properties.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p class="tdr"><i>Poetical Works, Pref. to Ed. of 1815</i>, p. 646, app. [<span class="smcl">T. &amp; H.</span> '51.]</p></div>

<p>So far as actual images are concerned, both <i>fancy</i> and <i>imagination</i>
are limited to the materials furnished by the external world;
it is remarkable that among all the representations of gods or
demigods, fiends and demons, griffins and chim&aelig;ras, the human
mind has never invented one organ or attribute that is not presented
in human or animal life; the lion may have a human head
and an eagle's wings and claws, but in the various features,
individually, there is absolutely nothing new. But <i>imagination</i>
can transcend the work of <i>fancy</i>, and compare an image drawn
from the external world with some spiritual truth born in the
mind itself, or infuse a series of images with such a spiritual
truth, molding them as needed for its more vivid expression.</p>

<div class="bq1"><p>The <i>imagination</i> modifies images, and gives unity to variety; it sees all things in
one.... There is the epic <i>imagination</i>, the perfection of which is in Milton; and
the dramatic, of which Shakspeare is the absolute master.</p>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smc">Coleridge</span> <i>Table Talk</i> June 23, '34.</p></div>

<p><i>Fancy</i> keeps the material image prominent and clear, and
works not only with it, but for it; <i>imagination</i> always uses the
material object as the minister of something greater than itself,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
and often almost loses the object in the spiritual idea with which
she has associated it, and for which alone she values it. <i>Fancy</i>
flits about the surface, and is airy and playful, sometimes petty
and sometimes false; <i>imagination</i> goes to the heart of things, and
is deep, earnest, serious, and seeks always and everywhere for essential
truth. <i>Fancy</i> sets off, variegates, and decorates; <i>imagination</i>
transforms and exalts. <i>Fancy</i> delights and entertains; <i>imagination</i>
moves and thrills. <i>Imagination</i> is not only poetic or
literary, but scientific, philosophical, and practical. By <i>imagination</i>
the architect sees the unity of a building not yet begun, and
the inventor sees the unity and varied interactions of a machine
never yet constructed, even a unity that no human eye ever can
see, since when the machine is in actual motion, one part may
hide the connecting parts, and yet all keep the unity of the inventor's
thought. By <i>imagination</i> a Newton sweeps sun, planets,
and stars into unity with the earth and the apple that is drawn irresistibly
to its surface, and sees them all within the circle of one
grand law. Science, philosophy, and mechanical invention have
little use for <i>fancy</i>, but the creative, penetrative power of <i>imagination</i>
is to them the breath of life, and the condition of all advance
and success. See also <span class="smcl"><a href="#FANCY">FANCY</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#IDEA">IDEA</a></span>.</p>

very long. Even <i>immediately</i> is sliding from its instantaneousness,

tho entirely proper and usual in early English. Baptists now
universally use the word <i>immerse</i>. To <i>dip</i> and to <i>immerse</i> alike
signify to <i>bury</i> or <i>submerge</i> some object in a liquid; but <i>dip</i> implies
that the object <i>dipped</i> is at once removed from the liquid,
while <i>immerse</i> is wholly silent as to the removal. <i>Immerse</i> also
suggests more absolute completeness of the action; one may <i>dip</i>
his sleeve or <i>dip</i> a sponge in a liquid, if he but touches the edge;
if he <i>immerses</i> it, he completely <i>sinks</i> it under, and covers it with
the liquid. <i>Submerge</i> implies that the object can not readily be
removed, if at all; as, a <i>submerged</i> wreck. To <i>plunge</i> is to
<i>immerse</i> suddenly and violently, for which <i>douse</i> and <i>duck</i> are
colloquial terms. <i>Dip</i> is used, also, unlike the other words, to
denote the putting of a hollow vessel into a liquid in order to
remove a portion of it; in this sense we say <i>dip up</i>, <i>dip out</i>.

<p><i>Difficulty</i> makes an undertaking otherwise than easy. That
which rests upon one as a burden is an <i>encumbrance</i>. An <i>impediment</i>
is primarily something that checks the foot or in any way
makes advance slow or difficult; an <i>obstacle</i> is something that
stands across the way, an <i>obstruction</i> something that is built or
placed across the way. An <i>obstruction</i> is always an <i>obstacle</i>, but
an <i>obstacle</i> may not always be properly termed an <i>obstruction</i>;
boxes and bales placed on the sidewalk are <i>obstructions</i> to travel;
an ice-floe is an <i>obstacle</i> to navigation, and may become an <i>obstruction</i>
if it closes an inlet or channel. A <i>hindrance</i> (kindred
with <i>hind</i>, <i>behind</i>) is anything that makes one come behind or
short of his purpose. An <i>impediment</i> may be either what one
finds in his way or what he carries with him; <i>impedimenta</i> was
the Latin name for the baggage of a soldier or of an army. The
tendency is to view an <i>impediment</i> as something constant or, at
least for a time, continuous; as, an <i>impediment</i> in one's speech.
A <i>difficulty</i> or a <i>hindrance</i> may be either within one or without;
a speaker may find <i>difficulty</i> in expressing himself, or <i>difficulty</i> in
holding the attention of restless children. An <i>encumbrance</i> is
always what one carries with him; an <i>obstacle</i> or an <i>obstruction</i>
is always without. To a marching soldier the steepness of a mountain
path is a <i>difficulty</i>, loose stones are <i>impediments</i>, a fence is an
<i>obstruction</i>, a cliff or a boulder across the way is an <i>obstacle</i>; a
knapsack is an <i>encumbrance</i>.</p>

<p><i>Impertinence</i> primarily denotes what does not pertain or belong

by word or act not consistent with the age, position, or relation
of the person interfered with or of the one who interferes;
especially, forward, presumptuous, or meddlesome speech. <i>Impudence</i>

<i>Impertinence</i> has less of intent and determination than <i>impudence</i>.
We speak of thoughtless <i>impertinence</i>, shameless <i>impudence</i>. <i>Insolence</i>
is literally that which is against custom, <i>i. e.</i>, the violation
of customary respect and courtesy. <i>Officiousness</i> is thrusting upon
others unasked and undesired service, and is often as well-meant
as it is annoying. <i>Rudeness</i> is the behavior that might be expected
from a thoroughly uncultured person, and may be either
deliberate and insulting or unintentional and even unconscious.

<p>Two or more things that do not fit well together, or are not

the term is also applied to a thing made up of ill-assorted

things that jar in association like musical notes that are not in accord;
<i>inharmonious</i> has the same original sense, but is a milder

are <i>incompatible</i> which can not exist together in harmonious relations,
and whose action when associated tends to ultimate extinction
of one by the other. <i>Inconsistent</i> applies to things that

<p><i>Deduction</i> is reasoning from the general to the particular; <i>induction</i>
is reasoning from the particular to the general. <i>Deduction</i>
proceeds from a general principle through an admitted instance
to a conclusion. <i>Induction</i>, on the other hand, proceeds
from a number of collated instances, through some attribute
common to them all, to a general principle. The proof of an <i>induction</i>
is by using its conclusion as the premise of a new <i>deduction</i>.
Thus what is ordinarily known as scientific <i>induction</i> is a
constant interchange of <i>induction</i> and <i>deduction</i>. In <i>deduction</i>,
if the general rule is true, and the special case falls under the
rule, the conclusion is certain; <i>induction</i> can ordinarily give no
more than a probable conclusion, because we can never be sure
that we have collated all instances. An <i>induction</i> is of the nature
of an <i>inference</i>, but while an <i>inference</i> may be partial and hasty,
an <i>induction</i> is careful, and aims to be complete. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#DEMONSTRATION">DEMONSTRATION</a></span>;

<p><i>Industrious</i> signifies zealously or habitually applying oneself to
any work or business. <i>Busy</i> applies to an activity which may be
temporary, <i>industrious</i> to a habit of life. We say a man is <i>busy</i> just
now; that is, <i>occupied</i> at the moment with something that
takes his full attention. It would be ridiculous or satirical to say,
he is <i>industrious</i> just now. But <i>busy</i> can be used in the sense of
<i>industrious</i>, as when we say he is a <i>busy</i> man. <i>Diligent</i> indicates
also a disposition, which is ordinarily habitual, and suggests more
of heartiness and volition than <i>industrious</i>. We say one is a <i>diligent</i>,
rather than an <i>industrious</i>, reader of the Bible. In the use<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>

<p><i>Industry</i> is the quality, action, or habit of earnest, steady, and
continued attention or devotion to any useful or productive
work or task, manual or mental. <i>Assiduity</i> (L. <i>ad</i>, to, and
<i>sedeo</i>, sit), as the etymology suggests, sits down to a task
until it is done. <i>Diligence</i> (L. <i>diligo</i>, love, choose) invests
more effort and exertion, with love of the work or deep
interest in its accomplishment; <i>application</i> (L. <i>ad</i>, to, and
<i>plico</i>, fold) bends to its work and concentrates all one's powers
upon it with utmost intensity; hence, <i>application</i> can hardly be
as unremitting as <i>assiduity</i>. <i>Constancy</i> is a steady devotion of
heart and principle. <i>Patience</i> works on in spite of annoyances;
<i>perseverance</i> overcomes hindrances and difficulties; <i>persistence</i>
strives relentlessly against opposition; <i>persistence</i> has very frequently
an unfavorable meaning, implying that one persists in spite
of considerations that should induce him to desist. <i>Industry</i> is
<i>diligence</i> applied to some avocation, business, or profession.
<i>Labor</i> and <i>pains</i> refer to the <i>exertions</i> of the worker and the tax
upon him, while <i>assiduity</i>, <i>perseverance</i>, etc., refer to his continuance

<p><i>Infinite</i> (L. <i>in</i>, not, and <i>finis</i>, limit) signifies without bounds or

denote what it is difficult or practically impossible to count or

leaves, the <i>countless</i> sands on the seashore, <i>numberless</i> battles, <i>innumerable</i>
delays. So, too, <i>boundless</i>, <i>illimitable</i>, <i>limitless</i>, <i>measureless</i>,

apparent or readily determinable limits in space or time; as, we

</table>

<p>To <i>influence</i> (L. <i>in</i>, in or into, and <i>fluo</i>, flow) is to affect, modify,
or act upon by physical, mental, or moral power, especially in
some gentle, subtle, and gradual way; as, vegetation is <i>influenced</i>
by light; every one is <i>influenced</i> to some extent by public opinion;
<i>influence</i> is chiefly used of power acting from without, tho it may
be used of motives regarded as forces acting upon the will. <i>Actuate</i>
refers solely to mental or moral power <i>impelling</i> one from
within. One may <i>influence</i>, but can not directly <i>actuate</i> another;
but one may be <i>actuated</i> to cruelty by hatred which another's misrepresentation
has aroused. <i>Prompt</i> and <i>stir</i> are words of mere
suggestion toward some course of action; <i>dispose</i>, <i>draw</i>, <i>incline</i>,
<i>influence</i>, and <i>lead</i> refer to the use of mild means to awaken in
another a purpose or disposition to act. To <i>excite</i> is to arouse one
from lethargy or indifference to action. <i>Incite</i> and <i>instigate</i>, to
spur or goad one to action, differ in the fact that <i>incite</i> may be to
good, while <i>instigate</i> is always to evil (compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#ABET">ABET</a></span>). To <i>urge</i>
and <i>impel</i> signify to produce strong excitation toward some act.
We are <i>urged</i> from without, <i>impelled</i> from within. <i>Drive</i> and
<i>compel</i> imply irresistible influence accomplishing its object. One
may be <i>driven</i> either by his own passions or by external force or
urgency; one is <i>compelled</i> only by some external power; as, the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>

<p><i>Inherent</i> signifies permanently united as an element or original
quality, naturally existent or incorporated in something so as to
have become an integral part. <i>Immanent</i> is a philosophic word,
to denote that which dwells in or pervades any substance or spirit
without necessarily being a part of it, and without reference to
any working out (compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#SUBJECTIVE">SUBJECTIVE</a></span>). That which is <i>inherent</i> is
an <i>inseparable</i> part of that in which it inheres, and is usually
thought of with reference to some outworking or effect; as, an
<i>inherent</i> difficulty. God is said to be <i>immanent</i> (not <i>inherent</i>) in
the universe. Frequently <i>intrinsic</i> and <i>inherent</i> can be interchanged,
but <i>inherent</i> applies to qualities, while <i>intrinsic</i> applies
to essence, so that to speak of <i>intrinsic</i> excellence conveys higher
praise than if we say <i>inherent</i> excellence. <i>Inherent</i> and <i>intrinsic</i>
may be said of persons or things; <i>congenital</i>, <i>inborn</i>, <i>inbred</i>, <i>innate</i>,
apply to living beings. <i>Congenital</i> is frequent in medical
and legal use with special application to defects; as, <i>congenital</i>
idiocy. <i>Innate</i> and <i>inborn</i> are almost identical, but <i>innate</i> is preferred
in philosophic use, as when we speak of <i>innate</i> ideas; that
which is <i>inborn</i>, <i>congenital</i>, or <i>innate</i> may be original with the
individual, but that which is <i>inbred</i> is inherited. <i>Ingrained</i> signifies
dyed in the grain, and denotes that which is deeply wrought
into substance or character.</p>

</table>

<p><i>Injury</i> (L. <i>in</i>, not, and <i>jus, juris</i>, right, law) signifies primarily
something done contrary to law or right; hence, something contrary
to some standard of right or good; whatever reduces the
value, utility, beauty, or desirableness of anything is an <i>injury</i> to
that thing; of persons, whatever is so done as to operate adversely
to one in his person, rights, property, or reputation is an <i>injury</i>;
the word is especially used of whatever mars the integrity of the
body or causes pain; as, when rescued from the wreck his <i>injuries</i>
were found to be very slight. <i>Injury</i> is the general term including
all the rest. <i>Damage</i> (L. <i>damnum</i>, loss) is that which occasions
<i>loss</i> to the possessor; hence, any impairment of value, often
with the suggestion of fault on the part of the one causing it;
<i>damage</i> reduces value, utility, or beauty; <i>detriment</i> (L. <i>deterere</i>,
to rub or wear away) is similar in meaning, but far milder. <i>Detriment</i>
may affect value only; <i>damage</i> always affects real worth
or utility; as a rule, the slightest use of an article by a purchaser
operates to its <i>detriment</i> if again offered for sale, tho the article
may have received not the slightest <i>damage</i>. <i>Damage</i> is partial;
<i>loss</i> is properly absolute as far as it is predicated at all; the <i>loss</i> of
a ship implies that it is gone beyond recovery; the <i>loss</i> of the rudder
is a <i>damage</i> to the ship; but since the <i>loss</i> of a part still leaves
a part, we may speak of a partial or a total <i>loss</i>. <i>Evil</i> commonly
suggests suffering or sin, or both; as, the <i>evils</i> of poverty, the social
<i>evil</i>. <i>Harm</i> is closely synonymous with <i>injury</i>; it may apply
to body, mind, or estate, but always affects real worth, while <i>injury</i>
may concern only estimated value. A <i>hurt</i> is an <i>injury</i> that
causes pain, physical or mental; a slight <i>hurt</i> may be no real
<i>harm</i>. <i>Mischief</i> is disarrangement, trouble, or <i>harm</i> usually
caused by some voluntary agent, with or without injurious intent;
a child's thoughtless sport may do great <i>mischief</i>; <i>wrong</i> is <i>harm</i>
done with <i>evil</i> intent. An <i>outrage</i> combines insult and <i>injury</i>.

<p><i>Injustice</i> is a violation or denial of justice, an act or omission
that is contrary to equity or justice; as, the <i>injustice</i> of unequal

damage or loss, not necessarily involving <i>injury</i> to person or property,
as by misrepresentation of goods which does not amount to
a legal warranty. In popular usage, <i>injustice</i> may involve no direct
<i>injury</i> to person, property, interest, or character, and no
harmful intent, while <i>wrong</i> always involves both; one who attributes
another's truly generous act to a selfish motive does him an

<p>Of these terms <i>insanity</i> is the most exact and comprehensive,
including in its widest sense all morbid conditions of mind due to
diseased action of the brain or nervous system, but in its more frequent
restricted use applied to those forms in which the mental
disorder is persistent, as distinguished from those in which it is
temporary or transient. <i>Craziness</i> is a vague popular term for
any sort of disordered mental action, or for conduct suggesting it.
<i>Lunacy</i> originally denoted intermittent <i>insanity</i>, supposed to be
dependent on the changes of the moon (L. <i>luna</i>): the term is now
applied in general and legal use to any form of mental unsoundness

<p>To <i>interpose</i> is to place or come between other things or persons,
usually as a means of obstruction or prevention of some
effect or result that would otherwise occur, or be expected to take
place. <i>Intercede</i> and <i>interpose</i> are used in a good sense; <i>intermeddle</i>
always in a bad sense, and <i>interfere</i> frequently so. To <i>intercede</i>
is to come between persons who are at variance, and plead
with the stronger in behalf of the weaker. One may <i>interpose</i>
with authority; he <i>intercedes</i> by petition. To <i>intermeddle</i> is to
thrust oneself into the concerns of others with a petty officiousness;
<i>meddling</i> commonly arises from idle curiosity; "every fool will
be <i>meddling</i>," <i>Prov.</i> xx, 3; to <i>interfere</i> is to intrude into others'
affairs with more serious purpose, with or without acknowledged
right or propriety. <i>Intercept</i> is applied to an object that may be
seized or stopped while in transit; as, to <i>intercept</i> a letter or a
messenger; <i>interrupt</i> is applied to an action which might or should
be continuous, but is broken in upon (L. <i>rumpere</i>, to break) by
some disturbing power; as, the conversation was <i>interrupted</i>.
One who <i>arbitrates</i> or <i>mediates</i> must do so by the request or at
least with the consent of the contending parties; the other words
of the group imply that he steps in of his own accord.</p>

<p>To <i>involve</i> (L. <i>in</i>, in, and <i>volvo</i>, roll) is to roll or wind up with
or in so as to combine inextricably or inseparably, or nearly so;
as, the nation is <i>involved</i> in war; the bookkeeper's accounts, or
the writer's sentences are <i>involved</i>. <i>Involve</i> is a stronger word
than <i>implicate</i>, denoting more complete entanglement. As applied
to persons, <i>implicate</i> is always used in an unfavorable sense,
and <i>involve</i> ordinarily so; but <i>implicate</i> applies only to that which
is wrong, while <i>involve</i> is more commonly used of that which is
unfortunate; one is <i>implicated</i> in a crime, <i>involved</i> in embarrassments,
misfortunes, or perplexities. As regards logical connection
that which is <i>included</i> is usually expressly stated; that which
is <i>implied</i> is not stated, but is naturally to be inferred; that which
is <i>involved</i> is necessarily to be inferred; as, a slate roof is <i>included</i>
in the contract; that the roof shall be water-tight is
<i>implied</i>; the contrary supposition <i>involves</i> an absurdity. See

fixed destination; a <i>journey</i> through Europe would be a passage
to some destination beyond or at the farther boundary; <i>travel</i> in
Europe may be in no direct course, but may include many <i>journeys</i>

to Chautauqua. <i>Passage</i> is a general word for a <i>journey</i> by
any conveyance, especially by water; as, a rough <i>passage</i> across
the Atlantic; <i>transit</i>, literally the act of passing over or through,

<p>In its governmental relations, human or divine, <i>justice</i> is the
giving to every person exactly what he deserves, not necessarily
involving any consideration of what any other may deserve; <i>equity</i>
(the quality of being equal) is giving every one as much advantage,
privilege, or consideration as is given to any other; it is that
which is equally right or just to all concerned; <i>equity</i> is equal
<i>justice</i> and is thus a close synonym for <i>fairness</i> and <i>impartiality</i>,
but it has a philosophical and legal precision that those words have
not. In legal proceedings cases arise for which the <i>law</i> has not
adequately provided, or in which general provisions, just in the
main, would work individual hardship. The system of <i>equity</i>, devised
to supply the insufficiencies of <i>law</i>, deals with cases "to
which the <i>law</i> by reason of its universality can not apply." "<i>Equity</i>,
then, ... is the soul and spirit of all <i>law</i>; positive <i>law</i> is construed
and rational <i>law</i> is made by it." <span class="smc">Blackstone</span> bk. iii, ch.
27, p. 429. In personal and social relations <i>justice</i> is the rendering
to every one what is due or merited, whether in act, word, or
thought; in matters of reasoning, or literary work of any kind,
<i>justice</i> is close, faithful, unprejudiced, and unbiased adherence to
essential truth or fact; we speak of the <i>justice</i> of a statement, or
of doing <i>justice</i> to a subject. <i>Integrity</i>, <i>rectitude</i>, <i>right</i>, <i>righteousness</i>
and <i>virtue</i> denote conformity of personal conduct to the
moral law, and thus necessarily include <i>justice</i>, which is giving
others that which is their due. <i>Lawfulness</i> is an ambiguous word,
meaning in its narrower sense mere <i>legality</i>, which may be very
far from <i>justice</i>, but in its higher sense signifying accordance with
the supreme <i>law</i> of <i>right</i>, and thus including perfect <i>justice</i>. <i>Justness</i>
refers rather to logical relations than to practical matters; as,
we speak of the <i>justness</i> of a statement or of a criticism. See

facts, truths, or principles acquired or retained by the mind, including
alike the <i>intuitions</i> native to the mind and all that has
been learned respecting phenomena, causes, laws, principles, literature,
etc. There is a tendency to regard <i>knowledge</i> as accurate
and systematic, and to a certain degree complete. <i>Information</i> is
<i>knowledge</i> of fact, real or supposed, derived from persons, books,
or observation, and is regarded as casual and haphazard. We say
of a studious man that he has a great store of <i>knowledge</i>, or of an
intelligent man of the world, that he has a fund of varied <i>information</i>.
<i>Lore</i> is used only in poetic or elevated style, for accumulated
<i>knowledge</i>, as of a people or age, or in a more limited sense
for <i>learning</i> or <i>erudition</i>. We speak of <i>perception</i> of external<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
objects, <i>apprehension</i> of intellectual truth. Simple <i>perception</i>
gives a limited <i>knowledge</i> of external objects, merely as such; the

relation; <i>cognizance</i> is the formal or official <i>recognition</i> of something
as an object of <i>knowledge</i>; we take <i>cognizance</i> of it.
<i>Intuition</i> is primary <i>knowledge</i> antecedent to all teaching or reasoning,

<p><i>Language</i> (F. <i>langage</i> &lt; L. <i>lingua</i>, the tongue) signified
originally <i>expression</i> of thought by spoken words, but now in its
widest sense it signifies <i>expression</i> of thought by any means; as,
the <i>language</i> of the eyes, the <i>language</i> of flowers. As regards
the use of words, <i>language</i> in its broadest sense denotes all the uttered
sounds and their combinations into words and sentences that
human beings employ for the communication of thought, and, in
a more limited sense, the words or combinations forming a means
of communication among the members of a single nation, people,
or race. <i>Speech</i> involves always the power of articulate utterance;
we can speak of the <i>language</i> of animals, but not of their
<i>speech</i>. A <i>tongue</i> is the <i>speech</i> or <i>language</i> of some one people,
country, or race. A <i>dialect</i> is a special mode of speaking a <i>language</i>
peculiar to some locality or class, not recognized as in accordance
with the best usage; a <i>barbarism</i> is a perversion of a
<i>language</i> by ignorant foreigners, or some usage akin to that.
<i>Idiom</i> refers to the construction of phrases and sentences, and the
way of forming or using words; it is the peculiar mold in which
each <i>language</i> casts its thought. The great difficulty of translation
is to give the thought expressed in one <i>language</i> in the <i>idiom</i>
of another. A <i>dialect</i> may be used by the highest as well as the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>

to the lower classes; those who speak a <i>patois</i> understand the
cultured form of their own language, but speak only the degraded
form, as in the case of the Italian lazzaroni or the former negro
slaves in the United States. <i>Vernacular</i>, from the Latin, has the

<p><i>Law</i>, in its ideal, is the statement of a <i>principle</i> of right in mandatory
form, by competent authority, with adequate penalty for
disobedience; in common use, the term is applied to any legislative
act, however imperfect or unjust. <i>Command</i> and <i>commandment</i>
are personal and particular; as, the <i>commands</i> of a parent;
the ten <i>commandments</i>. An <i>edict</i> is the act of an absolute
sovereign or other authority; we speak of the <i>edict</i> of an emperor,
the <i>decree</i> of a court. A <i>mandate</i> is specific, for an occasion or a
purpose; a superior court issues its <i>mandate</i> to an inferior court<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
to send up its records. <i>Statute</i> is the recognized legal term for a
specific <i>law</i>; <i>enactment</i> is the more vague and general expression.
We speak of algebraic or chemical <i>formulas</i>, municipal <i>ordinances</i>,
military <i>orders</i>, army <i>regulations</i>, ecclesiastical <i>canons</i>,
the <i>rules</i> of a business house. <i>Law</i> is often used, also, for a recognized
<i>principle</i>, whose violation is attended with injury or loss
that acts like a penalty; as, the <i>laws</i> of business; the <i>laws</i> of
nature. In more strictly scientific use, a natural <i>law</i> is simply a
recognized system of sequences or relations; as, Kepler's <i>laws</i> of
planetary distances. A <i>code</i> is a system of <i>laws</i>; <i>jurisprudence</i>
is the science of <i>law</i>, or a system of <i>laws</i> scientifically considered,
classed, and interpreted; <i>legislation</i>, primarily the act of legislating,
denotes also the body of <i>statutes</i> enacted by a legislative body.
An <i>economy</i> (Gr. <i>oikonomia</i>, primarily the management of a
house) is any comprehensive system of administration; as, domestic
<i>economy</i>; but the word is extended to the administration or
government of a state or people, signifying a body of <i>laws</i> and
<i>regulations</i>, with the entire system, political or religious, especially
the latter, of which they form a part; as, the <i>code</i> of Draco,
Roman <i>jurisprudence</i>, British <i>legislation</i>, the Mosaic <i>economy</i>.
<i>Law</i> is also used as a collective noun for a system of <i>laws</i> or recognized
<i>rules</i> or <i>regulations</i>, including not only all special <i>laws</i>,
but the <i>principles</i> on which they are based. The Mosaic <i>economy</i>
is known also as the Mosaic <i>law</i>, and we speak of the English
common <i>law</i>, or the <i>law</i> of nations. <i>Polity</i> (Gr. <i>politeia</i>, from
<i>polis</i>, a city) signifies the form, constitution, or method of government
of a nation, state, church, or other institution; in usage it
differs from <i>economy</i> as applying rather to the system, while
<i>economy</i> applies especially to method, or to the system as administered;
an <i>economy</i> might be termed a <i>polity</i> considered with especial
reference to its practical administration, hence commonly
with special reference to details or particulars, while <i>polity</i> has

or from restricting circumstances. <i>Freedom</i> and <i>liberty</i> are constantly
interchanged; the slave is set at <i>liberty</i>, or gains his <i>freedom</i>;
but <i>freedom</i> is the nobler word. <i>Independence</i> is said of
states or nations, <i>freedom</i> and <i>liberty</i> of individuals; the <i>independence</i>
of the United States did not secure <i>liberty</i> or <i>freedom</i> to
its slaves. <i>Liberty</i> keeps quite strictly to the thought of being
clear of restraint or compulsion; <i>freedom</i> takes a wider range,
applying to other oppressive influences; thus, we speak of <i>freedom</i>
from annoyance or intrusion. <i>License</i> is, in its limited sense, a
permission or privilege granted by adequate authority, a bounded
<i>liberty</i>; in the wider sense, <i>license</i> is an ignoring and defiance of
all that should restrain, and a reckless doing of all that individual
caprice or passion may choose to do&mdash;a base and dangerous counterfeit
of <i>freedom</i>. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#ALLOW">ALLOW</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#PERMISSION">PERMISSION</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Light</i>, strictly denoting a form of radiant energy, is used as a
general term for any luminous effect discernible by the eye, from
the faintest phosphorescence to the <i>blaze</i> of the noonday sun. A
<i>flame</i> is both hot and luminous; if it contains few solid particles
it will yield little <i>light</i>, tho it may afford intense heat, as in
the case of a hydrogen-<i>flame</i>. A <i>blaze</i> is an extensive, brilliant
<i>flame</i>. A <i>flare</i> is a wavering <i>flame</i> or <i>blaze</i>; a <i>flash</i> is
a <i>light</i> that appears and disappears in an instant; as, a
<i>flash</i> of lightning; the <i>flash</i> of gunpowder. The <i>glare</i> and
<i>glow</i> are steady, the <i>glare</i> painfully bright, the <i>glow</i> subdued; as,
the <i>glare</i> of torches; the <i>glow</i> of dying embers. <i>Shine</i> and <i>shining</i>
refer to a steady or continuous emission of <i>light</i>; <i>sheen</i> is a faint
<i>shining</i>, usually by reflection. <i>Glimmer</i>, <i>glitter</i>, and <i>shimmer</i>
denote wavering <i>light</i>. We speak of the <i>glimmer</i> of distant lamps
through the mist; of the <i>shimmer</i> of waves in sun<i>light</i> or moon<i>light</i>.
A <i>gleam</i> is not wavering, but transient or intermittent; a
sudden <i>gleam</i> of <i>light</i> came through the half-open door; a <i>glitter</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
is a hard <i>light</i>; as, the <i>glitter</i> of burnished arms. A <i>sparkle</i> is a
sudden <i>light</i>, as of sparks thrown out; <i>scintillation</i> is the more
exact and scientific term for the actual emission of sparks, also
the figurative term for what suggests such emission; as, <i>scintillations</i>
of wit or of genius. <i>Twinkle</i> and <i>twinkling</i> are used of the
intermittent <i>light</i> of the fixed stars. <i>Glistening</i> is a <i>shining</i> as
from a wet surface. <i>Illumination</i> is a wide-spread, brilliant <i>light</i>,
as when all the windows of a house or of a street are lighted.
The <i>light</i> of <i>incandescence</i> is intense and white like that from
metal at a white heat.</p>

loftiness of thought, and purity and beauty of style, as poetry,
history, fiction, and dramatic compositions, including also much
of philosophical writing, as the "Republic" of Plato, and oratorical
productions, as the orations of Demosthenes. In the broad

due to gravity; the same <i>weight</i> that one finds a moderate <i>load</i>
when in his full strength becomes a heavy <i>burden</i> in weariness or
weakness. A ship's <i>load</i> is called distinctively a <i>cargo</i>, or it may

</table>

<p><i>Affection</i> is kindly feeling, deep, tender, and constant, going out
to some person or object, being less fervent and ardent than <i>love</i>,
whether applied to persons or things. <i>Love</i> is an intense and
absorbing emotion, drawing one toward a person or object and
causing one to appreciate, delight in, and crave the presence or
possession of the person or object loved, and to desire to please and
benefit the person, or to advance the cause, truth, or other object
of <i>affection</i>; it is the yearning or outgoing of soul toward something
that is regarded as excellent, beautiful, or desirable; <i>love</i>
may be briefly defined as strong and absorbing <i>affection</i> for and
<i>attraction</i> toward a person or object. <i>Love</i> may denote the sublimest
and holiest spiritual <i>affection</i> as when we are taught that "God
is <i>love</i>." <i>Charity</i> has so far swung aside from this original meaning
that probably it never can be recalled (compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#BENEVOLENCE">BENEVOLENCE</a></span>).
The Revised Version uses <i>love</i> in place of <i>charity</i> in <i>1 Cor.</i>
xiii, and elsewhere. <i>Love</i> is more intense, absorbing, and tender
than <i>friendship</i>, more intense, impulsive, and perhaps passionate
than <i>affection</i>; we speak of fervent <i>love</i>, but of deep or tender
<i>affection</i>, or of close, firm, strong <i>friendship</i>. <i>Love</i> is used specifically
for personal <i>affection</i> between the sexes in the highest
sense, the <i>love</i> that normally leads to marriage, and subsists
throughout all happy wedded life. <i>Love</i> can never properly denote
mere animal passion, which is expressed by such words as appetite,
desire, lust. One may properly be said to have <i>love</i> for animals,
for inanimate objects, or for abstract qualities that enlist the
affections, as we speak of <i>love</i> for a horse or a dog, for mountains,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
woods, ocean, or of <i>love</i> of nature, and <i>love</i> of virtue. <i>Love</i> of
articles of food is better expressed by <i>liking</i>, as <i>love</i>, in its full
sense, expresses something spiritual and reciprocal, such as can
have no place in connection with objects that minister merely to
the senses. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#ATTACHMENT">ATTACHMENT</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#FRIENDSHIP">FRIENDSHIP</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Mercy</i> is the exercise of less severity than one deserves, or in a
more extended sense, the granting of <i>kindness</i> or <i>favor</i> beyond
what one may rightly claim. <i>Grace</i> is <i>favor</i>, <i>kindness</i>, or <i>blessing</i>
shown to the undeserving; <i>forgiveness</i>, <i>mercy</i>, and <i>pardon</i> are
exercised toward the ill-deserving. <i>Pardon</i> remits the outward
penalty which the offender deserves; <i>forgiveness</i> dismisses resentment
or displeasure from the heart of the one offended;<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
<i>mercy</i> seeks the highest possible good of the offender. There may
be <i>mercy</i> without <i>pardon</i>, as in the mitigation of sentence, or in
all possible alleviation of necessary severity; there may be cases
where <i>pardon</i> would not be <i>mercy</i>, since it would encourage to
repetition of the offense, from which timely punishment might
have saved. <i>Mercy</i> is also used in the wider sense of refraining
from harshness or cruelty toward those who are in one's power
without fault of their own; as, they besought the robber to have
<i>mercy</i>. <i>Clemency</i> is a colder word than <i>mercy</i>, and without its
religious associations, signifying <i>mildness</i> and moderation in the
use of power where severity would have legal or military,
rather than moral sanction; it often denotes a habitual <i>mildness</i>
of disposition on the part of the powerful, and is matter rather of
good nature or policy than of principle. <i>Leniency</i> or <i>lenity</i> denotes
an easy-going avoidance of severity; these words are more
general and less magisterial than <i>clemency</i>; we should speak of
the <i>leniency</i> of a parent, the <i>clemency</i> of a conqueror. Compare

</table>

<p><i>Mind</i>, in a general sense, includes all the powers of sentient
being apart from the physical factors in bodily faculties and activities;
in a limited sense, <i>mind</i> is nearly synonymous with <i>intellect</i>,
but includes <i>disposition</i>, or the tendency toward action, as appears
in the phrase "to have a <i>mind</i> to work." As the seat of mental
activity, <i>brain</i> (colloquially <i>brains</i>) is often used as a synonym for
<i>mind</i>, <i>intellect</i>, <i>intelligence</i>. <i>Thought</i>, the act, process, or power
of thinking, is often used to denote the thinking faculty, and especially
the <i>reason</i>. The <i>instinct</i> of animals is now held by many
philosophers to be of the same nature as the <i>intellect</i> of man, but
inferior and limited; yet the apparent difference is very great.</p>

<div class="bq1"><p>An <i>instinct</i> is a propensity prior to experience and independent of instruction.</p>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smc">Paley</span> <i>Natural Philosophy</i> ch. 18.</p></div>

<p>In this sense we speak of human <i>instincts</i>, thus denoting tendencies
independent of reasoning or instruction. The <i>soul</i> includes
the <i>intellect</i>, sensibilities, and will; beyond what is expressed by
the word <i>mind</i>, the <i>soul</i> denotes especially the moral, the immortal
nature; we say of a dead body, the <i>soul</i> (not the <i>mind</i>) has fled.
<i>Spirit</i> is used especially in contradistinction from matter; it may
in many cases be substituted for <i>soul</i>, but <i>soul</i> has commonly a
fuller and more determinate meaning; we can conceive of <i>spirits</i>
as having no moral nature; the fairies, elves, and brownies of
mythology might be termed <i>spirits</i>, but not <i>souls</i>. In the figurative
sense, <i>spirit</i> denotes animation, excitability, perhaps impatience;
as, a lad of <i>spirit</i>; he sang with <i>spirit</i>; he replied with
<i>spirit</i>. <i>Soul</i> denotes energy and depth of feeling, as when we
speak of soulful eyes; or it may denote the very life of anything;
as, "the hidden <i>soul</i> of harmony," <span class="smc">Milton</span> <i>L'Allegro</i> l. 144.
<i>Sense</i> may be an antonym of <i>intellect</i>, as when we speak of the
<i>sense</i> of hearing; but <i>sense</i> is used also as denoting clear mental
action, good judgment, acumen; as, he is a man of <i>sense</i>, or, he
showed good <i>sense</i>; <i>sense</i>, even in its material signification, must
be reckoned among the activities of <i>mind</i>, tho dependent on bodily
functions; the <i>mind</i>, not the eye, really sees; the <i>mind</i>, not
the ear, really hears. <i>Consciousness</i> includes all that a sentient
being perceives, knows, thinks, or feels, from whatever source
arising and of whatever character, kind, or degree, whether with<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
or without distinct thinking, feeling, or willing; we speak of the
<i>consciousness</i> of the brute, of the savage, or of the sage. The <i>intellect</i>
is that assemblage of faculties which is concerned with
knowledge, as distinguished from emotion and volition. <i>Understanding</i>
is the Saxon word of the same general import, but is
chiefly used of the reasoning powers; the <i>understanding</i>, which
Sir Wm. Hamilton has called "the faculty of relations and comparisons,"
is distinguished by many philosophers from <i>reason</i> in
that "<i>reason</i> is the faculty of the higher cognitions or a priori
truth."</p>

such as the sufferer is not deemed directly responsible for; as, he<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
had the <i>misfortune</i> to be born blind. Any considerable <i>disappointment</i>,
<i>failure</i>, or <i>misfortune</i>, as regards outward circumstances,
as loss of fortune, position, and the like, when long continued or
attended with enduring consequences, constitutes <i>adversity</i>. For
the loss of friends by death we commonly use <i>affliction</i> or <i>bereavement</i>.
<i>Calamity</i> and <i>disaster</i> are used of sudden and severe <i>misfortunes</i>,
often overwhelming; <i>ill fortune</i> and <i>ill luck</i>, of lighter
troubles and failures. We speak of the <i>misery</i> of the poor, the
<i>hardships</i> of the soldier. <i>Affliction</i>, <i>chastening</i>, <i>trial</i>, and <i>tribulation</i>
have all an especially religious bearing, suggesting some
disciplinary purpose of God with beneficent design. <i>Affliction</i>
may be keen and bitter, but brief; <i>tribulation</i> is long and wearing.
We speak of an <i>affliction</i>, but rarely of a <i>tribulation</i>, since
<i>tribulation</i> is viewed as a continuous process, which may endure
for years or for a lifetime; but we speak of our daily <i>trials</i>. Compare

general, and disposed to vent their ill nature upon others. The
<i>sullen</i> and <i>sulky</i> are for the most part silent; the <i>morose</i> growl
out bitter speeches. A <i>surly</i> person is in a state of latent anger,
resenting approach as intrusion, and ready to take offense at anything;
thus we speak of a <i>surly</i> dog. <i>Sullen</i> and <i>sulky</i> moods may

good writers hold it incorrect to say "a <i>mutual</i> friend," and insist

<p><i>Name</i> in the most general sense, signifying the word by which
a person or thing is called or known, includes all other words of
this group; in this sense every noun is a <i>name</i>; in the more limited
sense a <i>name</i> is personal, an <i>appellation</i> is descriptive, a <i>title</i>
is official. In the phrase William the Conqueror, King of England,
William is the man's <i>name</i>, which belongs to him personally,
independently of any rank or achievement; Conqueror is the <i>appellation</i>
which he won by his acquisition of England; King is
the <i>title</i> denoting his royal rank. An <i>epithet</i> (Gr. <i>epitheton</i>,
something added, from <i>epi</i>, on, and <i>tithemi</i>, put) is something
placed upon a person or thing; the <i>epithet</i> does not strictly belong
to an object like a <i>name</i>, but is given to mark some assumed
characteristic, good or bad; an <i>epithet</i> is always an adjective, or
a word or phrase used as an adjective, and is properly used to emphasize
a characteristic but not to add information, as in the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
phrase "the <i>sounding</i> sea;" the idea that an <i>epithet</i> is always
opprobrious, and that any word used opprobriously is an <i>epithet</i> is
a popular error. <i>Designation</i> may be used much in the sense of
<i>appellation</i>, but is more distinctive or specific in meaning; a <i>designation</i>
properly so called rests upon some inherent quality, while
an <i>appellation</i> may be fanciful. Among the Romans the <i>prenomen</i>
was the individual part of a man's <i>name</i>, the "nomen"
designated the gens to which he belonged, the <i>cognomen</i> showed
his family and was borne by all patricians, and the <i>agnomen</i> was
added to refer to his achievements or character. When scientists
<i>name</i> an animal or a plant, they give it a binary or binomial technical
<i>name</i> comprising a generic and a specific <i>appellation</i>. In
modern use, a personal <i>name</i>, as John or Mary, is given in infancy,
and is often called the given <i>name</i> or Christian <i>name</i>, or simply
the first <i>name</i> (rarely the <i>prenomen</i>); the <i>cognomen</i> or <i>surname</i>
is the family <i>name</i> which belongs to one by right of birth or marriage.
<i>Style</i> is the legal <i>designation</i> by which a person or house
is known in official or business relations; as, the <i>name</i> and <i>style</i>
of Baring Brothers. The term <i>denomination</i> is applied to a separate
religious organization, without the opprobrious meaning
attaching to the word "sect;" also, to designate any class of like objects
collectively, especially money or notes of a certain value; as,
the sum was in notes of the <i>denomination</i> of one thousand dollars.

<p>That which is <i>clean</i> is simply free from soil or defilement of
any kind. Things are <i>orderly</i> when in due relation to other things;
a room or desk is <i>orderly</i> when every article is in place; a person
is <i>orderly</i> who habitually keeps things so. <i>Tidy</i> denotes that
which conforms to propriety in general; an unlaced shoe may be
perfectly <i>clean</i>, but is not <i>tidy</i>. <i>Neat</i> refers to that which is <i>clean</i>
and <i>tidy</i> with nothing superfluous, conspicuous, or showy, as when
we speak of plain but <i>neat</i> attire; the same idea of freedom from
the superfluous appears in the phrases "a <i>neat</i> speech," "a <i>neat</i>
turn," "a <i>neat</i> reply," etc. A <i>clean</i> cut has no ragged edges; a
<i>neat</i> stroke just does what is intended. <i>Nice</i> is stronger than <i>neat</i>,
implying value and beauty; a <i>cheap</i>, coarse dress may be perfectly
<i>neat</i>, but would not be termed <i>nice</i>. <i>Spruce</i> is applied to the show
and affectation of neatness with a touch of smartness, and is always
a term of mild contempt; as, a <i>spruce</i> serving man. <i>Trim</i>
denotes a certain shapely and elegant firmness, often with suppleness
and grace; as, a <i>trim</i> suit; a <i>trim</i> figure. <i>Prim</i> applies to a
precise, formal, affected nicety. <i>Dapper</i> is <i>spruce</i> with the suggestion
of smallness and slightness; <i>natty</i>, a diminutive of <i>neat</i>,
suggests minute elegance, with a tendency toward the exquisite;
as, a <i>dapper</i> little fellow in a <i>natty</i> business suit.</p>

<p>That is <i>necessary</i> which must exist, occur, or be true; which
in the nature of things can not be otherwise. That which is <i>essential</i>
belongs to the essence of a thing, so that the thing can not exist
in its completeness without it; that which is <i>indispensable</i> may
be only an adjunct, but it is one that can not be spared; vigorous
health is <i>essential</i> to an arctic explorer; warm clothing is <i>indispensable</i>.
That which is <i>requisite</i> (or <i>required</i>) is so in the judgment
of the person requiring it, but may not be so absolutely; thus,
the <i>requisite</i> is more a matter of personal feeling than the <i>indispensable</i>.
<i>Inevitable</i> (L. <i>in</i>, not, and <i>evito</i>, shun) is primarily the
exact equivalent of the Saxon <i>unavoidable</i>; both words are applied
to things which some at least would escape or prevent, while
that which is <i>necessary</i> may meet with no objection; food is <i>necessary</i>,
death is <i>inevitable</i>; a <i>necessary</i> conclusion satisfies a
thinker; an <i>inevitable</i> conclusion silences opposition. An <i>infallible</i>
proof is one that necessarily leads the mind to a sound conclusion.
<i>Needed</i> and <i>needful</i> are more concrete than <i>necessary</i>, and

<i>necessary</i> food is what one can not live without, while <i>needful</i>
food is that without which he can not enjoy comfort, health, and

<p><i>Necessity</i> is the quality of being necessary, or the quality of that

<i>Need</i> and <i>want</i> always imply a lack; <i>necessity</i> may be used<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
in this sense, but in the higher philosophical sense <i>necessity</i> simply
denotes the exclusion of any alternative either in thought or fact;
righteousness is a <i>necessity</i> (not a <i>need</i>) of the divine nature.
<i>Need</i> suggests the possibility of supplying the deficiency which
<i>want</i> expresses; to speak of a person's <i>want</i> of decision merely
points out a weakness in his character; to say that he has <i>need</i> of
decision implies that he can exercise or attain it. As applied to a
deficiency, <i>necessity</i> is more imperative than <i>need</i>; a weary person
is in <i>need</i> of rest; when rest becomes a <i>necessity</i> he has no
choice but to stop work. An <i>essential</i> is something, as a quality,

be inseparable from it in its normal condition, or in any complete
idea or statement of it. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#NECESSARY">NECESSARY</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#PREDESTINATION">PREDESTINATION</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Neglect</i> (L. <i>nec</i>, not, and <i>lego</i>, gather) is the failing to take such
care, show such attention, pay such courtesy, etc., as may be rightfully
or reasonably expected. <i>Negligence</i>, which is the same in
origin, may be used in almost the same sense, but with a slighter
force, as when Whittier speaks of "the <i>negligence</i> which friendship
loves;" but <i>negligence</i> is often used to denote the quality or
trait of character of which the act is a manifestation, or to denote
the habit of neglecting that which ought to be done. <i>Neglect</i> is
transitive, <i>negligence</i> is intransitive; we speak of <i>neglect</i> of his
books, friends, or duties, in which cases we could not use <i>negligence</i>;
<i>negligence</i> in dress implies want of care as to its arrangement,
tidiness, etc.; <i>neglect</i> of one's garments would imply leaving
them exposed to defacement or injury, as by dust, moths, etc.
<i>Neglect</i> has a passive sense which <i>negligence</i> has not; the child
was suffering from <i>neglect</i>, <i>i. e.</i>, from being neglected by others;
the child was suffering from <i>negligence</i> would imply that he himself<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
was neglectful. The distinction sometimes made that <i>neglect</i>
denotes the act, and <i>negligence</i> the habit, is but partially true; one
may be guilty of habitual <i>neglect</i> of duty; the wife may suffer
from her husband's constant <i>neglect</i>, while the <i>negligence</i> which
causes a railroad accident may be that of a moment, and on the
part of one ordinarily careful and attentive; in such cases the law
provides punishment for criminal <i>negligence</i>.</p>

<p>That which is <i>new</i> has lately come into existence, possession,

that has just come into the possession of the present owner or
occupant. <i>Modern</i> denotes that which has begun to exist in the
present age, and is still existing; <i>recent</i> denotes that which has
come into existence within a comparatively brief period, and may
or may not be existing still. <i>Modern</i> history pertains to any period
since the middle ages; <i>modern</i> literature, <i>modern</i> architecture,
etc., are not strikingly remote from the styles and types prevalent
to-day. That which is <i>late</i> is somewhat removed from the present,
but not far enough to be called <i>old</i>. That which is <i>recent</i> is
not quite so sharply distinguished from the past as that which
is <i>new</i>; <i>recent</i> publications range over a longer time than
<i>new</i> books. That which is <i>novel</i> is either absolutely or relatively
unprecedented in kind; a <i>novel</i> contrivance is one that has
never before been known; a <i>novel</i> experience is one that has
never before occurred to the same person; that which is <i>new</i> may
be of a familiar or even of an ancient sort, as a <i>new</i> copy of an old
book. <i>Young</i> and <i>youthful</i> are applied to that which has life;
that which is <i>young</i> is possessed of a comparatively <i>new</i> existence
as a living thing, possessing actual youth; that which is <i>youthful</i>
manifests the attributes of youth. (Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#YOUTHFUL">YOUTHFUL</a></span>.)

<p>That is termed <i>old</i> which has existed long, or which existed
long ago. <i>Ancient</i>, from the Latin, through the French, is the
more stately, <i>old</i>, from the Saxon, the more familiar word. Familiarity,
on one side, is near to contempt; thus we say, an <i>old</i>
coat, an <i>old</i> hat. On the other hand, familiarity is akin to tenderness,
and thus <i>old</i> is a word of endearment; as, "the <i>old</i> homestead,"
the "<i>old</i> oaken bucket." "Tell me the <i>old, old</i> story!"
has been sung feelingly by millions; "tell me that <i>ancient</i> story"
would remove it out of all touch of human sympathy. <i>Olden</i> is a
statelier form of <i>old</i>, and is applied almost exclusively to time,
not to places, buildings, persons, etc. As regards periods of time,
the familiar are also the near; thus, the <i>old</i> times are not too far
away for familiar thought and reference; the <i>olden</i> times are more
remote, <i>ancient</i> times still further removed. <i>Gray</i>, <i>hoary</i>, and
<i>moldering</i> refer to outward and visible tokens of age. <i>Aged</i> applies
chiefly to long-extended human life. <i>Decrepit</i>, <i>gray</i>, and
<i>hoary</i> refer to the effects of age on the body exclusively; <i>senile</i>
upon the mind also; as, a <i>decrepit</i> frame, <i>senile</i> garrulousness.
One may be <i>aged</i> and neither <i>decrepit</i> nor <i>senile</i>. <i>Elderly</i> is applied
to those who have passed middle life, but scarcely reached<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>
<i>old</i> age. <i>Remote</i> (L. <i>re</i>, back or away, and <i>moveo</i>, move), primarily
refers to space, but is extended to that which is far off in
time; as, at some <i>remote</i> period. <i>Venerable</i> expresses the involuntary
reverence that we yield to the majestic and long-enduring,
whether in the material world or in human life and character.

<p><i>Instruction</i> implies superiority of knowledge, <i>direction</i> of authority
on the part of the giver; a teacher gives <i>instructions</i> to
his pupils, an employer gives <i>directions</i> to his workmen. <i>Order</i> is
still more authoritative than <i>direction</i>; soldiers, sailors, and railroad
employees have simply to obey the <i>orders</i> of their superiors,
without explanation or question; an <i>order</i> in the commercial sense
has the authority of the money which the one <i>ordering</i> the goods
pays or is to pay. <i>Command</i> is a loftier word, as well as highly
authoritative, less frequent in common life; we speak of the <i>commands</i>
of God, or sometimes, by polite hyperbole, ask of a friend,
"Have you any <i>commands</i> for me?" A <i>requirement</i> is imperative,
but not always formal, nor made by a personal agent; it may
be in the nature of things; as, the <i>requirements</i> of the position.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
<i>Prohibition</i> is wholly negative; it is a <i>command</i> not to do; <i>injunction</i>

</table>

<p><i>Ostentation</i> is an ambitious showing forth of whatever is
thought adapted to win admiration or praise; <i>ostentation</i> may be
without words; as, the <i>ostentation</i> of wealth in fine residences,
rich clothing, costly equipage, or the like; when in words, <i>ostentation</i>
is rather in manner than in direct statement; as, the <i>ostentation</i>
of learning. <i>Boasting</i> is in direct statement, and is louder
and more vulgar than <i>ostentation</i>. There may be great <i>display</i>
or <i>show</i> with little substance; <i>ostentation</i> suggests something
substantial to be shown. <i>Pageant</i>, <i>pageantry</i>, <i>parade</i>, and
<i>pomp</i> refer principally to affairs of arms or state; as, a royal
<i>pageant</i>; a military <i>parade</i>. <i>Pomp</i> is some material demonstration
of wealth and power, as in grand and stately ceremonial, rich
furnishings, processions, etc., considered as worthy of the person
or occasion in whose behalf it is manifested; <i>pomp</i> is the noble side
of that which as <i>ostentation</i> is considered as arrogant and vain.
<i>Pageant</i> and <i>pageantry</i> are inferior to <i>pomp</i>, denoting spectacular
<i>display</i> designed to impress the public mind, and since the
multitude is largely ignorant and thoughtless, the words <i>pageant</i>
and <i>pageantry</i> have a suggestion of the transient and unsubstantial.
<i>Parade</i> (L. <i>paro</i>, prepare) is an exhibition as of troops
in camp going through the evolutions that are to be used in battle,
and suggests a lack of earnestness and direct or immediate occasion
or demand; hence, in the more general sense, a <i>parade</i> is an
uncalled for exhibition, and so used is a more disparaging word
than <i>ostentation</i>; <i>ostentation</i> may spring merely from undue
self-gratulation, <i>parade</i> implies a desire to impress others with a
sense of one's abilities or resources, and is always offensive and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
somewhat contemptible; as, a <i>parade</i> of wealth or learning.
<i>Pomposity</i> and <i>pompousness</i> are the affectation of <i>pomp</i>.</p>

</table>

<p>One <i>ought</i> to do that which he is under moral obligation or in duty
bound to do. <i>Ought</i> is the stronger word, holding most closely to
the sense of moral obligation, or sometimes of imperative logical
necessity; <i>should</i> may have the sense of moral obligation or may
apply merely to propriety or expediency, as in the proverb, "The
liar <i>should</i> have a good memory," <i>i. e.</i>, he will need it. <i>Ought</i> is
sometimes used of abstractions or inanimate things as indicating
what the mind deems to be imperative or logically necessary in
view of all the conditions; as, these goods <i>ought</i> to go into that
space; these arguments <i>ought</i> to convince him; <i>should</i> in such
connections would be correct, but less emphatic. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#DUTY">DUTY</a></span>.</p>

</table>

<p>A person may look over a matter in order to survey it carefully
in its entirety, or he may look over it with no attention to the thing
itself because his gaze and thought are concentrated on something
beyond; <i>oversight</i> has thus two contrasted senses, in the latter
sense denoting inadvertent error or omission, and in the former denoting
watchful <i>supervision</i>, commonly implying constant personal
presence; <i>superintendence</i> requires only so much of presence
or communication as to know that the superintendent's wishes are
carried out; the superintendent of a railroad will personally oversee
very few of its operations; the railroad company has supreme
<i>direction</i> of all its affairs without <i>superintendence</i> or <i>oversight</i>.
<i>Control</i> is used chiefly with reference to restraint or the power of
restraint; a good horseman has a restless horse under perfect <i>control</i>;
there is no high character without self-<i>control</i>. <i>Surveillance</i>
is an invidious term signifying watching with something of
suspicion. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#CARE">CARE</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#NEGLECT">NEGLECT</a></span>.</p>

<tr><td>anguish,</td><td>paroxysm,</td><td>torment,</td><td>wo(e).</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Pain</i> is the most general term of this group, including all the
others; <i>pain</i> is a disturbing sensation from which nature revolts,
resulting from some injurious external interference (as from a
wound, a bruise, a harsh word, etc.), or from some lack of what
one needs, craves, or cherishes (as, the <i>pain</i> of hunger or bereavement),
or from some abnormal action of bodily or mental functions
(as, the <i>pains</i> of disease, envy, or discontent). <i>Suffering</i> is one of
the severer forms of <i>pain</i>. The prick of a needle causes <i>pain</i>, but
we should scarcely speak of it as <i>suffering</i>. <i>Distress</i> is too strong
a word for little hurts, too feeble for the intensest <i>suffering</i>, but
commonly applied to some continuous or prolonged trouble or
need; as, the <i>distress</i> of a shipwrecked crew, or of a destitute family.
<i>Ache</i> is lingering <i>pain</i>, more or less severe; <i>pang</i>, a <i>pain</i> short,
sharp, intense, and perhaps repeated. We speak of the <i>pangs</i> of
hunger or of remorse. <i>Throe</i> is a violent and thrilling <i>pain</i>. <i>Paroxysm</i>
applies to an alternately recurring and receding <i>pain</i>, which
comes as it were in waves; the <i>paroxysm</i> is the rising of the
wave. <i>Torment</i> and <i>torture</i> are intense and terrible <i>sufferings</i>.
<i>Agony</i> and <i>anguish</i> express the utmost <i>pain</i> or <i>suffering</i> of body
or mind. <i>Agony</i> of body is that with which the system struggles;
<i>anguish</i> that by which it is crushed.</p>

</table>

<p><i>Cloak</i>, from the French, and <i>palliate</i>, from the Latin, are the
same in original signification, but have diverged in meaning; a
<i>cloak</i> may be used to <i>hide</i> completely the person or some object
carried about the person, or it may but partly <i>veil</i> the figure,
making the outlines less distinct; <i>cloak</i> is used in the former,
<i>palliate</i>, in the latter sense; to <i>cloak</i> a sin is to attempt to <i>hide</i> it
from discovery; to <i>palliate</i> it is to attempt to <i>hide</i> some part of
its blameworthiness. "When we <i>palliate</i> our own or others'
faults we do not seek to <i>cloke</i> them altogether, but only to <i>extenuate</i>
the guilt of them in part." <span class="smc">Trench</span> <i>Study of Words</i> lect. vi, p.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
266. Either to <i>palliate</i> or to <i>extenuate</i> is to admit the fault; but
to <i>extenuate</i> is rather to <i>apologize</i> for the offender, while to
<i>palliate</i> is to disguise the fault; hence, we speak of <i>extenuating</i>
but not of <i>palliating</i> circumstances, since circumstances can not
change the inherent wrong of an act, tho they may lessen the
blameworthiness of him who does it; <i>palliating</i> a bad thing by
giving it a mild name does not make it less evil. In reference to
diseases, to <i>palliate</i> is really to diminish their violence, or partly
to relieve the sufferer. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#ALLEVIATE">ALLEVIATE</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#HIDE">HIDE</a></span>.</p>

<p>To <i>pardon</i> is to let pass, as a fault or sin, without resentment,
blame, or punishment. <i>Forgive</i> has reference to feelings, <i>pardon</i>
to consequences; hence, the executive may <i>pardon</i>, but has nothing
to do officially with <i>forgiving</i>. Personal injury may be <i>forgiven</i>
by the person wronged; thus, God at once <i>forgives</i> and
<i>pardons</i>; the <i>pardoned</i> sinner is exempt from punishment; the
<i>forgiven</i> sinner is restored to the divine favor. To <i>pardon</i> is the
act of a superior, implying the right to punish; to <i>forgive</i> is the
privilege of the humblest person who has been wronged or
offended. In law, to <i>remit</i> the whole penalty is equivalent to
<i>pardoning</i> the offender; but a part of a penalty may be <i>remitted</i>
and the remainder inflicted, as where the penalty includes both
fine and imprisonment. To <i>condone</i> is to put aside a recognized
offense by some act which restores the offender to forfeited right
or privilege, and is the act of a private individual, without legal
formalities. To <i>excuse</i> is to <i>overlook</i> some slight offense, error, or
breach of etiquette; <i>pardon</i> is often used by courtesy in nearly
the same sense. A person may speak of <i>excusing</i> or <i>forgiving</i>
himself, but not of <i>pardoning</i> himself. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#ABSOLVE">ABSOLVE</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#PARDON_n">PARDON</a></span>,

<p><i>Acquittal</i> is a release from a charge, after trial, as not guilty.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
<i>Pardon</i> is a removal of penalty from one who has been adjudged
guilty. <i>Acquittal</i> is by the decision of a court, commonly of a
jury; <i>pardon</i> is the act of the executive. An innocent man may
demand <i>acquittal</i>, and need not plead for <i>pardon</i>. <i>Pardon</i> supposes
an offense; yet, as our laws stand, to grant a <i>pardon</i> is
sometimes the only way to release one who has been wrongly convicted.
<i>Oblivion</i>, from the Latin, signifies overlooking and virtually
forgetting an offense, so that the offender stands before the
law in all respects as if it had never been committed. <i>Amnesty</i>
brings the same idea through the Greek. <i>Pardon</i> affects individuals;
<i>amnesty</i> and <i>oblivion</i> are said of great numbers. <i>Pardon</i>
is oftenest applied to the ordinary administration of law; <i>amnesty</i>,
to national and military affairs. An <i>amnesty</i> is issued after war,
insurrection, or rebellion; it is often granted by "an act of <i>oblivion</i>,"
and includes a full <i>pardon</i> of all offenders who come within
its provisions. <i>Absolution</i> is a religious word (compare synonyms

inanimate things; as, the <i>earnings</i> of capital. <i>Hire</i> is distinctly
mercenary or menial, but as a noun has gone out of popular use,
tho the verb <i>to hire</i> is common. <i>Salary</i> is for literary or professional
work, <i>wages</i> for handicraft or other comparatively inferior
service; a <i>salary</i> is regarded as more permanent than <i>wages</i>;
an editor receives a <i>salary</i>, a compositor receives <i>wages</i>. <i>Stipend</i>

<p>A <i>community</i> is in general terms the aggregate of persons inhabiting
any territory in common and viewed as having common
interests; a <i>commonwealth</i> is such a body of persons having a
common government, especially a republican government; as, the
<i>commonwealth</i> of Massachusetts. A <i>community</i> may be very
small; a <i>commonwealth</i> is ordinarily of considerable extent. A
<i>people</i> is the aggregate of any public <i>community</i>, either in distinction<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
from their rulers or as including them; a <i>race</i> is a division of
mankind in the line of origin and ancestry; the <i>people</i> of the
United States includes members of almost every <i>race</i>. The use of
<i>people</i> as signifying persons collectively, as in the statement "The
hall was full of <i>people</i>," has been severely criticized, but is old and
accepted English, and may fitly be classed as idiomatic, and often
better than <i>persons</i>, by reason of its collectivism. As Dean Alford
suggests, it would make a strange transformation of the old hymn
"All <i>people</i> that on earth do dwell" to sing "All <i>persons</i> that on
earth do dwell." A <i>state</i> is an organized political <i>community</i> considered
in its corporate capacity as "a body politic and corporate;"
as, a legislative act is the act of the <i>state</i>; every citizen is
entitled to the protection of the <i>state</i>. A <i>nation</i> is an organized
political <i>community</i> considered with reference to the persons composing
it as having certain definite boundaries, a definite number
of citizens, etc. The members of a <i>people</i> are referred to as persons
or individuals; the individual members of a <i>state</i> or <i>nation</i>
are called citizens or subjects. The <i>population</i> of a country is
simply the aggregate of persons residing within its borders, without
reference to <i>race</i>, organization, or allegiance; unnaturalized
residents form part of the <i>population</i>, but not of the <i>nation</i>, possessing
none of the rights and being subject to none of the duties
of citizens. In American usage <i>State</i> signifies one <i>commonwealth</i>
of the federal union known as the United <i>States</i>. <i>Tribe</i> is now
almost wholly applied to rude <i>peoples</i> with very imperfect political
organization; as, the Indian <i>tribes</i>; nomadic <i>tribes</i>. Compare

<p>That is <i>perfect</i> to which nothing can be added, and from

marring its symmetry, or detracting from its worth; in this fullest
sense God alone is <i>perfect</i>, but in a limited sense anything may be
<i>perfect</i> in its kind; as a <i>perfect</i> flower; a copy of a document is
<i>perfect</i> when it is <i>accurate</i> in every particular; a vase may be
called <i>perfect</i> when <i>entire</i> and <i>unblemished</i>, even tho not artistically
<i>faultless</i>; the best judges never pronounce a work of art
<i>perfect</i>, because they see always <i>ideal</i> possibilities not yet attained;
even the <i>ideal</i> is not <i>perfect</i>, by reason of the imperfection
of the human mind; a human character faultlessly <i>holy</i> would be
morally <i>perfect</i> tho finite. That which is <i>absolute</i> is free from
admixture (as <i>absolute</i> alcohol) and in the highest and fullest
sense free from imperfection or limitation; as, <i>absolute</i> holiness
and love are attributes of God alone. In philosophical language,
<i>absolute</i> signifies free from all necessary, or even from all possible
relations, not dependent or limited, unrelated and unconditioned;
truth immediately known, as intuitive truth, is <i>absolute</i>; God, as
self-existent and free from all limitation or dependence, is called
the <i>absolute</i> Being, or simply the <i>Absolute</i>. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#INNOCENT">INNOCENT</a></span>;

<p><i>Authority</i> unites the right and power of control; age, wisdom,

research has <i>authority</i>, and is even called an <i>authority</i>. <i>Permission</i>
justifies another in acting without interference or censure,
and usually implies some degree of approval. <i>Authority</i> gives a
certain right of control over all that may be affected by the action.
There may be a failure to object, which constitutes an implied
<i>permission</i>, tho this is more properly expressed by <i>allowance</i>;
we <i>allow</i> what we do not oppose, <i>permit</i> what we expressly
authorize. The noun <i>permit</i> implies a formal written
<i>permission</i>. <i>License</i> is a formal <i>permission</i> granted by competent
<i>authority</i> to an individual to do some act or pursue some
business which would be or is made to be unlawful without such
<i>permission</i>; as, a <i>license</i> to preach, to solemnize marriages, or to
sell intoxicating liquors. A <i>license</i> is <i>permission</i> granted rather

<p><i>Perplexity</i> (L. <i>per</i>, through, and <i>plecto</i>, plait) is the drawing or
turning of the thoughts or faculties by turns in different directions
or toward contrasted or contradictory conclusions; <i>confusion</i> (L.
<i>confusus</i>, from <i>confundo</i>, pour together) is a state in which the
mental faculties are, as it were, thrown into chaos, so that the
clear and distinct action of the different powers, as of perception,
memory, reason, and will is lost; <i>bewilderment</i> is akin to <i>confusion</i>,
but is less overwhelming, and more readily recovered from;
<i>perplexity</i>, accordingly, has not the unsettling of the faculties
implied in <i>confusion</i>, nor the overwhelming of the faculties implied
in <i>amazement</i> or <i>astonishment</i>; it is not the magnitude of
the things to be known, but the want of full and definite knowledge,
that causes <i>perplexity</i>. The dividing of a woodland path
may cause the traveler the greatest <i>perplexity</i>, which may become
<i>bewilderment</i> when he has tried one path after another and lost
his bearings completely. With an excitable person <i>bewilderment</i>
may deepen into <i>confusion</i> that will make him unable to think
clearly or even to see or hear distinctly. <i>Amazement</i> results from
the sudden and unimagined occurrence of great good or evil or<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>

<p>Of these words <i>convince</i> alone has no direct reference to moving
the will, denoting an effect upon the understanding only; one
may be <i>convinced</i> of his duty without doing it, or he may be <i>convinced</i>
of truth that has no manifest connection with duty or action,
as of a mathematical proposition. To <i>persuade</i> is to bring the will
of another to a desired decision by some influence exerted upon it
short of compulsion; one may be <i>convinced</i> that the earth is round;
he may be <i>persuaded</i> to travel round it; but persuasion is so largely
dependent upon conviction that it is commonly held to be the orator's
work first to <i>convince</i> in order that he may <i>persuade</i>. <i>Coax</i>
is a slighter word than <i>persuade</i>, seeking the same end by shallower
methods, largely by appeal to personal feeling, with or without
success; as, a child <i>coaxes</i> a parent to buy him a toy. One
may be <i>brought over</i>, <i>induced</i>, or <i>prevailed upon</i> by means not

which is merely an object of thought, <i>pitiable</i> for that which is
brought directly before the senses; as, a <i>pitiful</i> story; a <i>pitiable</i>
object; a <i>pitiable</i> condition. Since pity, however, always implies
weakness or inferiority in that which is pitied, <i>pitiful</i> and <i>pitiable</i>
are often used, by an easy transition, for what might awaken
pity, but does awaken contempt; as, a <i>pitiful</i> excuse; he presented

<p><i>Pity</i> is a feeling of grief or pain aroused by the weakness, misfortunes,

<i>Sympathy</i> (feeling or suffering with) implies some degree
of equality, kindred, or union; <i>pity</i> is for what is weak or unfortunate,

often resented where <i>sympathy</i> would be welcome. We have
<i>sympathy</i> with one in joy or grief, in pleasure or pain, <i>pity</i> only
for those in suffering or need; we may have <i>sympathy</i> with the
struggles of a giant or the triumphs of a conqueror; we are moved
with <i>pity</i> for the captive or the slave. <i>Pity</i> may be only in the
mind, but <i>mercy</i> does something for those who are its objects.
<i>Compassion</i>, like <i>pity</i>, is exercised only with respect to the suffering
or unfortunate, but combines with the tenderness of <i>pity</i> the
dignity of <i>sympathy</i> and the active quality of <i>mercy</i>. <i>Commiseration</i>
is as tender as <i>compassion</i>, but more remote and hopeless;

<h3>PLEASANT.</h3>

<h4>Synonyms:</h4>

<table class="tbs" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>agreeable,</td><td>good-natured,</td><td>kindly,</td><td>pleasing,</td></tr>
<tr><td>attractive,</td><td>kind,</td><td>obliging,</td><td>pleasurable.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>That is <i>pleasing</i> from which pleasure is received, or may readily
be received, without reference to any action or intent in that
which confers it; as, a <i>pleasing</i> picture; a <i>pleasing</i> landscape.
Whatever has active qualities adapted to give pleasure is <i>pleasant</i>;
as, a <i>pleasant</i> breeze; a <i>pleasant</i> (not a <i>pleasing</i>) day. As applied
to persons, <i>pleasant</i> always refers to a disposition ready and desirous
to please; one is <i>pleasant</i>, or in a <i>pleasant</i> mood, when inclined
to make happy those with whom he is dealing, to show
kindness and do any reasonable favor. In this sense <i>pleasant</i> is
nearly akin to <i>kind</i>, but <i>kind</i> refers to act or intent, while <i>pleasant</i>
stops with the disposition; many persons are no longer in a <i>pleasant</i>
mood if asked to do a troublesome kindness. <i>Pleasant</i> keeps
always something of the sense of actually giving pleasure, and
thus surpasses the meaning of <i>good-natured</i>; there are <i>good-natured</i>
people who by reason of rudeness and ill-breeding are
not <i>pleasant</i> companions. A <i>pleasing</i> face has good features,
complexion, expression, etc.; a <i>pleasant</i> face indicates a <i>kind</i>
heart and an <i>obliging</i> disposition, as well as <i>kindly</i> feelings in
actual exercise; we can say of one usually <i>good-natured</i>, "on<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
that occasion he did not meet me with a <i>pleasant</i> face." <i>Pleasant</i>,
in the sense of gay, merry, jocose (the sense still retained in
<i>pleasantry</i>), is now rare, and would not be understood outside of
literary circles. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#AMIABLE">AMIABLE</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#COMFORTABLE">COMFORTABLE</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#DELIGHTFUL">DELIGHTFUL</a></span>.</p>

</table>

<p><i>Enough</i> is relative, denoting a supply equal to a given demand.
A temperature of 70&deg; Fahrenheit is <i>enough</i> for a living-room; of
212&deg; <i>enough</i> to boil water; neither is <i>enough</i> to melt iron. <i>Sufficient</i>,
from the Latin, is an equivalent of the Saxon <i>enough</i>, with
no perceptible difference of meaning, but only of usage, <i>enough</i>
being the more blunt, homely, and forcible word, while <i>sufficient</i> is
in many cases the more elegant or polite. <i>Sufficient</i> usually precedes
its noun; <i>enough</i> usually and preferably follows. That is
<i>ample</i> which gives a safe, but not a large, margin beyond a given
demand; that is <i>abundant</i>, <i>affluent</i>, <i>bountiful</i>, <i>liberal</i>, <i>plentiful</i>,
which is largely in excess of manifest need. <i>Plentiful</i> is used of
supplies, as of food, water, etc.; as, "a <i>plentiful</i> rain," <i>Ps.</i> lxviii,
9. We may also say a <i>copious</i> rain; but <i>copious</i> can be applied to
thought, language, etc., where <i>plentiful</i> can not well be used.
<i>Affluent</i> and <i>liberal</i> both apply to riches, resources; <i>liberal</i>, with
especial reference to giving or expending. (Compare synonyms
for <span class="smcl"><a href="#ADEQUATE">ADEQUATE</a></span>.) <i>Affluent</i>, referring
especially to riches, may be used of thought, feeling, etc.
Neither <i>affluent</i>, <i>copious</i>, nor <i>plentiful</i> can be used of time or
space; a field is sometimes called <i>plentiful</i>, not with reference
to its extent, but to its productiveness. <i>Complete</i> expresses not
excess or overplus, and yet not mere sufficiency, but harmony,
proportion, fitness to a design, or ideal. <i>Ample</i> and <i>abundant</i> may
be applied to any subject. We have time <i>enough</i>, means that
we can reach our destination without haste, but also without
delay; if we have <i>ample</i> time, we may move leisurely, and note<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
what is by the way; if we have <i>abundant</i> time, we may pause to
converse with a friend, to view the scenery, or to rest when weary.
<i>Lavish</i> and <i>profuse</i> imply a decided excess, oftenest in the ill
sense. We rejoice in <i>abundant</i> resources, and honor <i>generous</i>
hospitality; <i>lavish</i> or <i>profuse</i> expenditure suggests extravagance
and wastefulness. <i>Luxuriant</i> is used especially of that which is
<i>abundant</i> in growth; as, a <i>luxuriant</i> crop.</p>

<p><i>Poetry</i> is that form of literature that embodies beautiful
thought, feeling, or action in melodious, rhythmical, and (usually)
metrical language, in imaginative and artistic constructions.
<i>Poetry</i> in a very wide sense may be anything that pleasingly
addresses the imagination; as, the <i>poetry</i> of motion. In ordinary
usage, <i>poetry</i> is both imaginative and metrical. There may be <i>poetry</i>
without <i>rime</i>, but hardly without <i>meter</i>, or what in some languages
takes its place, as the Hebrew parallelism; but <i>poetry</i> involves,
besides the artistic form, the exercise of the fancy or
imagination in a way always beautiful, often lofty or even sublime.
Failing this, there may be <i>verse</i>, <i>rime</i>, and <i>meter</i>, but not
<i>poetry</i>. There is much in literature that is beautiful and sublime
in thought and artistic in construction, which is yet not <i>poetry</i>,
because quite devoid of the element of <i>song</i>, whereby <i>poetry</i>
differs from the most lofty, beautiful, or impassioned prose.

<p>A <i>civil</i> person observes such propriety of speech and manner as<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
to avoid being rude; one who is <i>polite</i> (literally <i>polished</i>) observes
more than the necessary proprieties, conforming to all that is
graceful, becoming, and thoughtful in the intercourse of refined
society. A man may be <i>civil</i> with no consideration for others,
simply because self-respect forbids him to be rude; but one who
is <i>polite</i> has at least some care for the opinions of others, and if
<i>polite</i> in the highest and truest sense, which is coming to be the
prevailing one, he cares for the comfort and happiness of others in
the smallest matters. <i>Civil</i> is a colder and more distant word than
<i>polite</i>; <i>courteous</i> is fuller and richer, dealing often with greater
matters, and is used only in the good sense. <i>Courtly</i> suggests
that which befits a royal court, and is used of external grace and
stateliness without reference to the prompting feeling; as, the
<i>courtly</i> manners of the ambassador. <i>Genteel</i> refers to an external
elegance, which may be showy and superficial, and the word is
thus inferior to <i>polite</i> or <i>courteous</i>. <i>Urbane</i> refers to a politeness
that is genial and successful in giving others a sense of ease and
cheer. <i>Polished</i> refers to external elegancies of speech and manner
without reference to spirit or purpose; as, a <i>polished</i> gentleman
or a <i>polished</i> scoundrel; <i>cultured</i> refers to a real and high
development of mind and soul, of which the external manifestation
is the smallest part. <i>Complaisant</i> denotes a disposition to
please or favor beyond what <i>politeness</i> would necessarily require.</p>

use serves a valuable purpose in distinguishing that which relates
to administration and government from that which relates

corrode a metal; the <i>power</i> of a polished surface to reflect light.
<i>Ability</i> is nearly coextensive with <i>power</i>, but does not reach the
positiveness and vigor that may be included in the meaning of
<i>power</i>, <i>ability</i> often implying latent, as distinguished from active
<i>power</i>; we speak of an exertion of <i>power</i>, but not of an exertion
of <i>ability</i>. <i>Power</i> and <i>ability</i> include <i>capacity</i>, which is <i>power</i> to
receive; but <i>ability</i> is often distinguished from <i>capacity</i>, as power
that may be manifested in doing, as <i>capacity</i> is in receiving; one
may have great <i>capacity</i> for acquiring knowledge, and yet not
possess <i>ability</i> to teach. <i>Efficiency</i> is active <i>power</i> to effect a definite
result, the <i>power</i> that actually does, as distinguished from
that which may do. <i>Competency</i> is equal to the occasion, <i>readiness</i>
prompt for the occasion. <i>Faculty</i> is an inherent quality of
mind or body; <i>talent</i>, some special mental <i>ability</i>. <i>Dexterity</i> and
<i>skill</i> are readiness and facility in action, having a special end;
<i>talent</i> is innate, <i>dexterity</i> and <i>skill</i> are largely acquired. Our
<i>abilities</i> include our natural <i>capacity</i>, <i>faculties</i>, and <i>talents</i>, with
all the <i>dexterity</i>, <i>skill</i>, and <i>readiness</i> that can be acquired. <i>Efficacy</i>
is the power to produce an intended effect as shown in the
production of it; as, the <i>efficacy</i> of a drug. <i>Efficiency</i> is effectual
agency, competent <i>power</i>; <i>efficiency</i> is applied in mechanics as
denoting the ratio of the effect produced to the <i>power</i> expended in

<p><i>Praise</i> is the hearty approval of an individual, or of a number
or multitude considered individually, and is expressed by
spoken or written words; <i>applause</i>, the spontaneous outburst of
many at once. <i>Applause</i> is expressed in any way, by stamping of
feet, clapping of hands, waving of handkerchiefs, etc., as well as
by the voice; <i>acclamation</i> is the spontaneous and hearty approval<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
of many at once, and strictly by the voice alone. Thus one is
chosen moderator by <i>acclamation</i> when he receives a unanimous
<i>viva voce</i> vote; we could not say he was nominated by <i>applause</i>.
<i>Acclaim</i> is the more poetic term for <i>acclamation</i>, commonly understood
in a loftier sense; as, a nation's <i>acclaim</i>. <i>Plaudit</i> is a
shout of <i>applause</i>, and is commonly used in the plural; as, the
<i>plaudits</i> of a throng. <i>Applause</i> is also used in the general sense
of <i>praise</i>. <i>Approbation</i> is a milder and more qualified word than
<i>praise</i>; while <i>praise</i> is always uttered, <i>approbation</i> may be
silent. "<i>Approbation</i> speaks of the thing or action.... <i>Praise</i>
is always personal." <span class="smc">A. W. and J. C. Hare</span> <i>Guesses at Truth</i>
first series, p. 549. [<span class="smc">Macm.</span> '66.] <i>Acceptance</i> refers to an object or
action; <i>approbation</i> may refer to character or natural traits.
<i>Approval</i> always supposes a testing or careful examination, and
frequently implies official sanction; <i>approbation</i> may be upon a
general view. The industry and intelligence of a clerk win his
employer's <i>approbation</i>; his decision in a special instance
receives his <i>approval</i>. <i>Praise</i> is always understood as genuine
and sincere, unless the contrary is expressly stated; <i>compliment</i> is
a light form of <i>praise</i> that may or may not be sincere; <i>flattery</i> is
insincere and ordinarily fulsome <i>praise</i>.</p>

<h4>Synonyms:</h4>

<tr><td>anticipate,</td><td>forestall,</td><td>obviate,</td><td>preclude.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The original sense of <i>prevent</i>, to come before, act in advance of,
which is now practically obsolete, was still in good use when the
authorized version of the Bible was made, as appears in such passages
as, "When Peter was come into the house, Jesus <i>prevented</i>
him" (<i>i. e.</i>, addressed him first), <i>Matt.</i> xvii, 25; "Thou <i>preventest</i>
him with the blessings of goodness" (<i>i. e.</i>, by sending the blessings
before the desire is formulated or expressed), <i>Ps.</i> xxi, 3. <i>Anticipate</i>
is now the only single word usable in this sense; to <i>forestall</i>
is to take or act in advance in one's own behalf and to the prejudice
of another or others, as in the phrase "to <i>forestall</i> the market."
But to <i>anticipate</i> is very frequently used in the favorable
sense; as, his thoughtful kindness <i>anticipated</i> my wish (<i>i. e.</i>, met
the wish before it was expressed): or we say, "I was about to
accost him when he <i>anticipated</i> me" (by speaking first); or one
<i>anticipates</i> a payment (by making it before the time); in neither
of these cases could we use <i>forestall</i> or <i>prevent</i>. To <i>obviate</i> (literally,
to stop the way of or remove from the way), is to <i>prevent</i>
by interception, so that something that would naturally withstand
or disturb may be kept from doing so; to <i>preclude</i>, (literally, to
close or shut in advance) is to <i>prevent</i> by anticipation or by logical
necessity; walls and bars <i>precluded</i> the possibility of escape; a
supposition is <i>precluded</i>; a necessity or difficulty is <i>obviated</i>. <i>Prevent</i>,
which at first had only the anticipatory meaning, has come
to apply to the stopping of an action at any stage, the completion
or conclusion only being thought of as negatived by anticipation;
the enemy passed the outworks and were barely <i>prevented</i> from
capturing the fortress. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#HINDER">HINDER</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#PROHIBIT">PROHIBIT</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Antecedent</i> may denote simple priority in time, implying no
direct connection between that which goes before and that which
follows; as, the striking of one clock may be always <i>antecedent</i>
to the striking of another with no causal connection between them.
<i>Antecedent</i> and <i>previous</i> may refer to that which goes or happens at
any distance in advance, <i>preceding</i> is limited to that which is immediately
or next before; an <i>antecedent</i> event may have happened
at any time before; the <i>preceding</i> transaction is the one completed
just before the one with which it is compared; a <i>previous</i>
statement or chapter may be in any part of the book that has gone
before; the <i>preceding</i> statement or chapter comes next before
without an interval. <i>Previous</i> often signifies first by right; as, a
<i>previous</i> engagement. <i>Foregoing</i> is used only of that which is
spoken or written; as, the <i>foregoing</i> statements. <i>Anterior</i>, while
it can be used of time, is coming to be employed chiefly with reference
to place; as the <i>anterior</i> lobes of the brain. <i>Prior</i> bears
exclusive reference to time, and commonly where that which is
first in time is first also in right; as, a <i>prior</i> demand. <i>Former</i> is
used of time, or of position in written or printed matter, not of
space in general. We can say <i>former</i> times, a <i>former</i> chapter,
etc., but not the <i>former</i> part of a garden; we should say the <i>front</i>
part of the garden, the <i>forward</i> car of a train. <i>Former</i> has a close
relation, or sharp contrast, with something following; the <i>former</i>
always implies the latter, even when not fully expressed, as in
<i>Acts</i> i, 1, and <i>Eccles.</i> vii, 10.</p>

<p>The <i>cost</i> of a thing is all that has been expended upon it,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
whether in discovery, production, refinement, decoration, transportation,
or otherwise, to bring it to its present condition in the hands
of its present possessor; the <i>price</i> of a thing is what the seller
asks for it. In regular business, as a rule, the seller's <i>price</i> on
his wares must be more than their <i>cost</i> to him; when goods are
sold, the <i>price</i> the buyer has paid becomes their <i>cost</i> to himself.
In exceptional cases, when goods are sold at <i>cost</i>, the seller's <i>price</i>
is made the same as the <i>cost</i> of the goods to him, the <i>cost</i> to the
seller and the <i>cost</i> to the buyer becoming then identical. <i>Price</i>
always implies that an article is for sale; what a man will not
sell he declines to put a <i>price</i> on; hence the significance of the
taunting proverb that "every man has his <i>price</i>." <i>Value</i> is the
estimated equivalent for an article, whether the article is for sale
or not; the market <i>value</i> is what it would bring if exposed for sale
in the open market; the intrinsic <i>value</i> is the inherent utility of
the article considered by itself alone; the market <i>value</i> of an old
and rare volume may be very great, while its intrinsic <i>value</i> may
be practically nothing. <i>Value</i> has always more reference to
others' estimation (literally, what the thing will avail with others)
than <i>worth</i>, which regards the thing in and by itself; thus, intrinsic
<i>value</i> is a weaker expression than intrinsic <i>worth</i>. <i>Charge</i> has
especial reference to services, <i>expense</i> to minor outlays; as, the
<i>charges</i> of a lawyer or physician; traveling <i>expenses</i>; household
<i>expenses</i>.</p>

<p><i>Haughtiness</i> thinks highly of itself and poorly of others. <i>Arrogance</i>
claims much for itself and concedes little to others. <i>Pride</i>
is an absorbing sense of one's own greatness; <i>haughtiness</i> feels
one's own superiority to others; <i>disdain</i> sees contemptuously the
inferiority of others to oneself. <i>Presumption</i> claims place or
privilege above one's right; <i>pride</i> deems nothing too high. <i>Insolence</i>
is open and rude expression of contempt and hostility, generally
from an inferior to a superior, as from a servant to a master
or mistress. In the presence of superiors overweening <i>pride</i>
manifests itself in <i>presumption</i> or <i>insolence</i>; in the presence of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
inferiors, or those supposed to be inferior, <i>pride</i> manifests itself
by <i>arrogance</i>, <i>disdain</i>, <i>haughtiness</i>, <i>superciliousness</i>, or in either
case often by cold <i>reserve</i>. (See <span class="smcl">RESERVE</span> under <span class="smcl"><a href="#MODESTY">MODESTY</a></span>.) <i>Pride</i>
is too self-satisfied to care for praise; <i>vanity</i> intensely craves admiration
and applause. <i>Superciliousness</i>, as if by the uplifted
eyebrow, as its etymology suggests (L. <i>supercilium</i>, eyebrow, from
<i>super</i>, over and <i>cilium</i>, eyelid), silently manifests mingled
<i>haughtiness</i> and <i>disdain</i>. <i>Assumption</i> quietly takes for granted
superiority and privilege which others would be slow to concede.
<i>Conceit</i> and <i>vanity</i> are associated with weakness, <i>pride</i> with
strength. <i>Conceit</i> may be founded upon nothing; <i>pride</i> is
founded upon something that one is, or has, or has done; <i>vanity</i>,
too, is commonly founded on something real, tho far slighter than
would afford foundation for <i>pride</i>. <i>Vanity</i> is eager for admiration
and praise, is elated if they are rendered, and pained if they
are withheld, and seeks them; <i>pride</i> could never solicit admiration
or praise. <i>Conceit</i> is somewhat stronger than <i>self-conceit</i>.
<i>Self-conceit</i> is ridiculous; <i>conceit</i> is offensive. <i>Self-respect</i> is a
thoroughly worthy feeling; <i>self-esteem</i> is a more generous estimate
of one's own character and abilities than the rest of the
world are ready to allow. <i>Vainglory</i> is more pompous and boastful
than <i>vanity</i>. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#EGOTISM">EGOTISM</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#OSTENTATION">OSTENTATION</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Aboriginal</i> (L. <i>ab</i>, from, <i>origo</i>, origin) signifies pertaining to
the <i>aborigines</i> or earliest known inhabitants of a country in the
widest sense, including not merely human beings but inferior animals
and plants as well. <i>Autochthonic</i> (Gr. <i>autos</i>, self, and <i>chth&#333;n</i>,
earth) signifies sprung from the earth, especially from the soil of
one's native land. <i>Primeval</i> (L. <i>primum</i>, first, and <i>&aelig;vum</i>, age),
signifies strictly belonging to the first ages, earliest in time, but often
only the earliest of which man knows or conceives, <i>immemorial</i>.
<i>Aboriginal</i>, <i>autochthonic</i>, and <i>primeval</i> combine the meanings of
<i>ancient</i> and <i>original</i>; <i>aboriginal</i> inhabitants, <i>autochthonic</i> races,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
<i>primeval</i> forests. <i>Prime</i> and <i>primary</i> may signify either first in
time, or more frequently first in importance; <i>primary</i> has also the
sense of elementary or preparatory; we speak of a <i>prime</i> minister,
a <i>primary</i> school. <i>Primal</i> is chiefly poetic, in the sense of <i>prime</i>;
as, the <i>primal</i> curse. <i>Primordial</i> is first in an order of succession or
development; as, a <i>primordial</i> leaf. <i>Primitive</i> frequently signifies
having the original characteristics of that which it represents,
as well as standing first in time; as, the <i>primitive</i> church. <i>Primitive</i>
also very frequently signifies having the original or early
characteristics without remoteness in time. <i>Primeval</i> simplicity
is the simplicity of the earliest ages; <i>primitive</i> simplicity may be
found in retired villages now. <i>Pristine</i> is an elegant word, used
almost exclusively in a good sense of that which is <i>original</i> and
perhaps <i>ancient</i>; as, <i>pristine</i> purity, innocence, vigor. That
which is both an <i>original</i> and natural product of a soil or country
is said to be <i>indigenous</i>; that which is actually produced there is
said to be <i>native</i>, though it may be of foreign extraction; humming-birds
are <i>indigenous</i> to America; canaries may be <i>native</i>,
but are not <i>indigenous</i>. <i>Immemorial</i> refers solely to time, independently

<p><i>Progress</i> (L. <i>pro</i>, forward, <i>gradior</i>, go) is a moving onward or
forward, whether in space or in the mental or moral realm, and
may be either mechanical, individual, or social. <i>Attainment</i>, <i>development</i>,
and <i>proficiency</i> are more absolute than the other words
of the group, denoting some point of advantage or of comparative
perfection reached by forward or onward movement; we speak
of <i>attainments</i> in virtue or scholarship, <i>proficiency</i> in music or
languages, the <i>development</i> of new powers or organs; <i>proficiency</i>
includes the idea of skill. <i>Advance</i> may denote either a forward
movement or the point gained by forward movement, but always
relatively with reference to the point from which the movement
started; as, this is a great <i>advance</i>. <i>Advance</i> admits the possibility
of retreat; <i>progress</i> (L. <i>progredi</i>, to walk forward) is steady
and constant forward movement, admitting of pause, but not of
retreat; <i>advance</i> suggests more clearly a point to be reached,
while <i>progress</i> lays the emphasis upon the forward movement;
we may speak of slow or rapid <i>progress</i>, but more naturally of
swift <i>advance</i>. <i>Progress</i> is more frequently used of abstractions;
as, the <i>progress</i> of ideas; <i>progression</i> fixes the attention chiefly
upon the act of moving forward. In a thing good in itself all <i>advance</i>
or <i>progress</i> is <i>improvement</i>; there is a growing tendency to
restrict the words to this favorable sense, using <i>increase</i> indifferently
of good or evil; one may say without limitation, "I am an

<p>To <i>prohibit</i> is to give some formal command against, and especially
to make some authoritative legal enactment against. <i>Debar</i>
is said of persons, <i>disallow</i> of acts; one is <i>debarred</i> from anything
when shut off, as by some irresistible authority or necessity; one
is <i>prohibited</i> from an act in express terms; he may be <i>debarred</i>
by silent necessity. An act is <i>disallowed</i> by the authority that
might have allowed it; the word is especially applied to acts which
are done before they are pronounced upon; thus, a government
may <i>disallow</i> the act of its commander in the field or its admiral
on the high seas. <i>Inhibit</i> and <i>interdict</i> are chiefly known by
their ecclesiastical use. As between <i>forbid</i> and <i>prohibit</i>, <i>forbid</i>
is less formal and more personal, <i>prohibit</i> more official and judicial,
with the implication of readiness to use such force as may be
needed to give effect to the enactment; a parent <i>forbids</i> a child to
take part in some game or to associate with certain companions;
the slave-trade is now <i>prohibited</i> by the leading nations of the
world. Many things are <i>prohibited</i> by law which can not be
wholly <i>prevented</i>, as gambling and prostitution; on the other
hand, things may be <i>prevented</i> which are not <i>prohibited</i>, as the
services of religion, the payment of debts, or military conquest.

<i>proposition</i> is often used nearly in the sense of <i>proposal</i> when it

<p>In its most frequent use, <i>propose</i> differs from <i>purpose</i> in that
what we <i>purpose</i> lies in our own mind, as a decisive act of will, a
determination; what we <i>propose</i> is offered or stated to others. In
this use of the word, what we <i>propose</i> is open to deliberation, as
what we <i>purpose</i> is not. In another use of the word, one <i>proposes</i>
something to or by himself which may or may not be stated to
others. In this latter sense <i>propose</i> is nearly identical with <i>purpose</i>,
and the two words have often been used interchangeably.
But in the majority of cases what we <i>purpose</i> is more general,
what we <i>propose</i> more formal and definite; I <i>purpose</i> to do right;
I <i>propose</i> to do this specific thing because it is right. In the historic
sentence, "I <i>propose</i> to move immediately on your works,"
<i>purpose</i> would not have the same sharp directness.</p>

may <i>delay</i> a person as well as an action, but <i>defer</i> and <i>protract</i>
are not used of persons. <i>Elongate</i> is not used of actions or abstractions,
but only of material objects or extension in space; <i>protract</i>
is very rarely used of concrete objects or extension in space;
we <i>elongate</i> a line, <i>protract</i> a discussion. <i>Protract</i> has usually
an unfavorable sense, implying that the matter referred to is already
unduly long, or would be so if longer <i>continued</i>; <i>continue</i>
is neutral, applying equally to the desirable or the undesirable.
<i>Postpone</i> implies a definite intention to resume, as <i>defer</i> also does,
though less decidedly; both are often used with some definite
limitation of time; as, to <i>postpone</i> till, until, or to a certain day
or hour. One may <i>defer</i>, <i>delay</i>, or <i>postpone</i> a matter intelligently
and for good reason; he <i>procrastinates</i> through indolence and
irresolution. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#HINDER">HINDER</a></span>.</p>

<p>The <i>proverb</i> or <i>adage</i> gives homely truth in condensed, practical
form, the <i>adage</i> often pictorial. "Hope deferred maketh
the heart sick" is a <i>proverb</i>; "The cat loves fish, but dares not
wet her feet," is an <i>adage</i>. Both the <i>proverb</i> and the <i>adage</i>, but
especially the latter, are thought of as ancient and widely
known. An <i>aphorism</i> partakes of the character of a definition;
it is a summary statement of what the author sees and believes to
be true. An <i>apothegm</i> is a terse statement of what is plain or
easily proved. The <i>aphorism</i> is philosophical, the <i>apothegm</i> practical.<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
A <i>dictum</i> is a statement of some person or school, on whom
it depends for authority; as, a <i>dictum</i> of Aristotle. A <i>saying</i> is
impersonal, current among the common people, deriving its authority
from its manifest truth or good sense; as, it is an old
<i>saying</i>, "the more haste, the worse speed." A <i>saw</i> is a <i>saying</i>
that is old, but somewhat worn and tiresome. <i>Precept</i> is a command
to duty; <i>motto</i> or <i>maxim</i> is a brief statement of cherished
truth, the <i>maxim</i> being more uniformly and directly practical;
"God is love" may be a <i>motto</i>, "Fear God and fear naught," a
<i>maxim</i>. The <i>precepts</i> of the Sermon on the Mount will furnish
the Christian with invaluable <i>maxims</i> or <i>mottoes</i>. A <i>byword</i> is a
phrase or <i>saying</i> used reproachfully or contemptuously.</p>

<p><i>Bravery</i>, <i>courage</i>, <i>heroism</i>, and <i>intrepidity</i> may be silent,
spiritual, or passive; they may be exhibited by a martyr at the
stake. <i>Prowess</i> and <i>valor</i> imply both daring and doing; we do
not speak of the <i>prowess</i> of a martyr, a child, or a passive sufferer.
<i>Valor</i> meets odds or perils with courageous action, doing
its utmost to conquer at any risk or cost; <i>prowess</i> has power
adapted to the need; dauntless <i>valor</i> is often vain against superior
<i>prowess</i>. <i>Courage</i> is a nobler word than <i>bravery</i>, involving more
of the deep, spiritual, and enduring elements of character; such
an appreciation of peril as would extinguish <i>bravery</i> may only
intensify <i>courage</i>, which is resistant and self-conquering; <i>courage</i>
applies to matters in regard to which <i>valor</i> and <i>prowess</i> can have
no place, as submission to a surgical operation, or the facing of
censure or detraction for conscience' sake. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#BRAVE">BRAVE</a></span>;

<p><i>Prudence</i> may be briefly defined as good <i>judgment</i> and <i>foresight</i>,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
inclining to <i>caution</i> and <i>frugality</i> in practical affairs. <i>Care</i>
may respect only the present; <i>prudence</i> and <i>providence</i> look far
ahead and sacrifice the present to the future, <i>prudence</i> watching,
saving, guarding, <i>providence</i> planning, doing, preparing, and perhaps
expending largely to meet the future demand. <i>Frugality</i> is
in many cases one form of <i>prudence</i>. In a besieged city <i>prudence</i>
will reduce the rations, <i>providence</i> will strain every nerve to introduce
supplies and to raise the siege. <i>Foresight</i> merely sees the
future, and may even lead to the recklessness and desperation to
which <i>prudence</i> and <i>providence</i> are so strongly opposed. <i>Forethought</i>
is thinking in accordance with wise views of the future,
and is nearly equivalent to <i>providence</i>, but it is a more popular
and less comprehensive term; we speak of man's <i>forethought</i>,
God's <i>providence</i>. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#CARE">CARE</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#FRUGALITY">FRUGALITY</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#WISDOM">WISDOM</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Buy</i> and <i>purchase</i> are close synonyms, signifying to <i>obtain</i> or
<i>secure</i> as one's own by paying or promising to pay a price; in numerous
cases the two words are freely interchangeable, but with the difference
usually found between words of Saxon and those of French
or Latin origin. The Saxon <i>buy</i> is used for all the homely and
petty concerns of common life, the French <i>purchase</i> is often restricted
to transactions of more dignity; yet the Saxon word <i>buy</i>
is commonly more emphatic, and in the higher ranges of thought
appeals more strongly to the feelings. One may either <i>buy</i> or
<i>purchase</i> fame, favor, honor, pleasure, etc., but when our feelings
are stirred we speak of victory or freedom as dearly <i>bought</i>. "<i>Buy</i>
the truth, and sell it not" (<i>Prov.</i> xxiii, 23) would be greatly weakened
by the rendering "<i>Purchase</i> the truth, and do not dispose of
it." Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#BUSINESS">BUSINESS</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#GET">GET</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#PRICE">PRICE</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#SALE">SALE</a></span>.</p>

<p>That is <i>pure</i> which is free from mixture or contact with anything
that weakens, impairs, or pollutes. Material substances are
called <i>pure</i> in the strict sense when free from foreign admixture
of any kind; as, <i>pure</i> oxygen; the word is often used to signify
free from any defiling or objectionable admixture (the original
sense); we speak of water as <i>pure</i> when it is bright, clear, and refreshing,
tho it may contain mineral salts in solution; in the medical
and chemical sense, only distilled water (<i>aqua pura</i>) is <i>pure</i>.
In moral and religious use <i>pure</i> is a strong word, denoting positive
excellence of a high order; one is <i>innocent</i> who knows nothing of
evil, and has experienced no touch of temptation; one is <i>pure</i>
who, with knowledge of evil and exposure to temptation, keeps
heart and soul <i>unstained</i>. <i>Virtuous</i> refers primarily to right action;
<i>pure</i> to right feeling and motives; as, "Blessed are the <i>pure</i>

<i>put</i> a horse in a pasture, or <i>put</i> a bullet in a rifle or into an enemy.
<i>Place</i> denotes more careful movement and more exact location;
as, to <i>place</i> a crown on one's head, or a garrison in a city. To
<i>lay</i> is to <i>place</i> in a horizontal position; to <i>set</i> is to <i>place</i> in an upright
position; we <i>lay</i> a cloth, and <i>set</i> a dish upon a table. To
<i>deposit</i> is to <i>put</i> in a place of security for future use; as, to <i>deposit</i>
money in a bank; the original sense, to <i>lay</i> down or let down
(quietly), is also common; as, the stream <i>deposits</i> sediment.</p>

<p><i>Odd</i> is unmated, as an <i>odd</i> shoe, and so uneven, as an <i>odd</i>
number. <i>Singular</i> is alone of its kind; as, the <i>singular</i> number.
What is <i>singular</i> is <i>odd</i>, but what is <i>odd</i> may not be <i>singular</i>; as,
a drawerful of <i>odd</i> gloves. A <i>strange</i> thing is something hitherto
unknown in fact or in cause. A <i>singular</i> coincidence is one the
happening of which is unusual; a <i>strange</i> coincidence is one the
cause of which is hard to explain. That which is <i>peculiar</i> belongs
especially to a person as his own; as, Israel was called Jehovah's
"<i>peculiar</i> people," <i>i. e.</i>, especially chosen and cherished by him;
in its ordinary use there is the implication that the thing <i>peculiar</i>
to one is not common to the majority nor quite approved by them,
though it may be shared by many; as, the Shakers are <i>peculiar</i>.
<i>Eccentric</i> is off or aside from the center, and so off or aside from
the ordinary and what is considered the normal course; as, genius
is commonly <i>eccentric</i>. <i>Eccentric</i> is a higher and more respectful
word than <i>odd</i> or <i>queer</i>. <i>Erratic</i> signifies wandering, a stronger
and more censorious term than <i>eccentric</i>. <i>Queer</i> is transverse or
oblique, aside from the common in a way that is <i>comical</i> or perhaps
slightly <i>ridiculous</i>. <i>Quaint</i> denotes that which is pleasingly <i>odd</i>
and fanciful, often with something of the antique; as, the <i>quaint</i>
architecture of medieval towns. That which is <i>funny</i> is calculated
to provoke laughter; that which is <i>droll</i> is more quietly
amusing. That which is <i>grotesque</i> in the material sense is irregular
or misshapen in form or outline or ill-proportioned so as to be
somewhat <i>ridiculous</i>; the French <i>bizarre</i> is practically equivalent
to <i>grotesque</i>.</p>

<p>To <i>quicken</i>, in the sense here considered, is to increase speed,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
move or cause to move more rapidly, as through more space or with,
a greater number of motions in the same time. To <i>accelerate</i> is to
increase the speed of action or of motion. A motion whose speed
increases upon itself is said to be <i>accelerated</i>, as the motion of a
falling body, which becomes swifter with every second of time.
To <i>accelerate</i> any work is to <i>hasten</i> it toward a finish, commonly
by <i>quickening</i> all its operations in orderly unity toward the result.
To <i>despatch</i> is to do and be done with, to get a thing off one's
hands. To <i>despatch</i> an enemy is to kill him outright and quickly;
to <i>despatch</i> a messenger is to send him in haste; to <i>despatch</i> a business
is to bring it quickly to an end. <i>Despatch</i> is commonly used
of single items. To <i>promote</i> a cause is in any way to bring it forward,
<i>advance</i> it in power, prominence, etc. To <i>speed</i> is really to
secure swiftness; to <i>hasten</i> is to attempt it, whether successfully or
unsuccessfully. <i>Hurry</i> always indicates something of confusion.
The <i>hurried</i> man forgets dignity, appearance, comfort, courtesy,
everything but speed; he may forget something vital to the matter
in hand; yet, because reckless haste may attain the great object
of speed, <i>hurry</i> has come to be the colloquial and popular
word for acting quickly. To <i>facilitate</i> is to <i>quicken</i> by making
easy; to <i>expedite</i> is to <i>quicken</i> by removing hindrances. A good
general will improve roads to <i>facilitate</i> the movements of troops,
<i>hasten</i> supplies and perfect discipline to <i>promote</i> the general efficiency
of the force, <i>despatch</i> details of business, <i>expedite</i> all preparations,
in order to <i>accelerate</i> the advance and victory of his
army.</p>

<p>To <i>quote</i> is to give an author's words, either exactly, as in direct
quotation, or in substance, as in indirect quotation; to <i>cite</i> is, etymologically,
to call up a passage, as a witness is summoned. In
<i>citing</i> a passage its exact location by chapter, page, or otherwise,
must be given, so that it can be promptly called into evidence; in
<i>quoting</i>, the location may or may not be given, but the words or
substance of the passage must be given. In <i>citing</i>, neither the
author's words nor his thought may be given, but simply the reference
to the location where they may be found. To <i>quote</i>, in the<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
proper sense, is to give credit to the author whose words are employed.
To <i>paraphrase</i> is to state an author's thought more freely
than in indirect quotation, keeping the substance of thought and
the order of statement, but changing the language, and commonly
interweaving more or less explanatory matter as if part of the original
writing. One may <i>paraphrase</i> a work with worthy motive for
homiletic, devotional, or other purposes (as in the metrical versions
of the Psalms), or he may <i>plagiarize</i> atrociously in the form of
<i>paraphrase</i>, appropriating all that is valuable in another's thought,
with the hope of escaping detection by change of phrase. To
<i>plagiarize</i> is to <i>quote</i> without credit, appropriating another's
words or thought as one's own. To <i>recite</i> or <i>repeat</i> is usually to
<i>quote</i> orally, tho <i>recite</i> is applied in legal phrase to a particular
statement of facts which is not a quotation; a kindred use obtains
in ordinary speech; as, to <i>recite</i> one's misfortunes.</p>

<p><i>Unique</i> is alone of its kind; <i>rare</i> is <i>infrequent</i> of its kind;
great poems are <i>rare</i>; "Paradise Lost" is <i>unique</i>. To say of a
thing that it is <i>rare</i> is simply to affirm that it is now seldom
found, whether previously common or not; as, a <i>rare</i> old book;
a <i>rare</i> word; to call a thing <i>scarce</i> implies that it was at some
time more plenty, as when we say food or money is <i>scarce</i>. A
particular fruit or coin may be <i>rare</i>; <i>scarce</i> applies to demand
and use, and almost always to concrete things; to speak of virtue,
genius, or heroism as <i>scarce</i> would be somewhat ludicrous. <i>Rare</i>
has the added sense of <i>precious</i>, which is sometimes, but not
necessarily, blended with that above given; as, a <i>rare</i> gem. <i>Extraordinary</i>,
signifying greatly beyond the ordinary, is a neutral
word, capable of a high and good sense or of an invidious, opprobrious,

<h3><a name="REASON_v" id="REASON_v"></a>REASON, <span class="nbi">v.</span></h3>

<h4>Synonyms:</h4>

<p>To <i>reason</i> is to examine by means of the reason, to prove by
reasoning, or to influence or seek to influence others by reasoning
or reasons. Persons may <i>contend</i> either from mere ill will or self-interest,
or from the highest motives; "That ye should earnestly
<i>contend</i> for the faith which was once delivered to the saints," <i>Jude</i>
3. To <i>argue</i> (L. <i>arguo</i>, show) is to make a matter clear by reasoning;
to <i>discuss</i> (L. <i>dis</i>, apart, and <i>quatio</i>, shake) is, etymologically,
to shake it apart for examination and analysis. <i>Demonstrate</i>
strictly applies to mathematical or exact reasoning; <i>prove</i> may be
used in the same sense, but is often applied to reasoning upon matters
of fact by what is called probable evidence, which can give
only moral and not absolute or mathematical certainty. To <i>demonstrate</i>
is to force the mind to a conclusion by irresistible reasoning;
to <i>prove</i> is rather to <i>establish</i> a fact by evidence; as, to <i>prove</i>
one innocent or guilty. That which has been either <i>demonstrated</i>
or <i>proved</i> so as to secure general acceptance is said to be <i>established</i>.
<i>Reason</i> is a neutral word, not, like <i>argue</i>, <i>debate</i>, <i>discuss</i>,
etc., naturally or necessarily implying contest. We <i>reason</i>
about a matter by bringing up all that reason can give us on any
side. A <i>dispute</i> may be personal, fractious, and petty; a <i>debate</i>
is formal and orderly; if otherwise, it becomes a mere <i>wrangle</i>.</p>

<h4>Prepositions:</h4>

<p>We reason <i>with</i> a person <i>about</i> a subject, <i>for</i> or <i>against</i> an
opinion; we reason a person <i>into</i> or <i>out of</i> a course of action; or
we may reason <i>down</i> an opponent or opposition; one reasons <i>from</i>
a cause <i>to</i> an effect.</p>

<p>While the <i>cause</i> of any event, act, or fact, as commonly understood,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
is the power that makes it to be, the <i>reason</i> of or for it is the
explanation given by the human mind; but <i>reason</i> is, in popular
language, often used as equivalent to <i>cause</i>, especially in the sense
of <i>final cause</i>. In the statement of any reasoning, the <i>argument</i>
may be an entire syllogism, or the premises considered together
apart from the conclusion, or in logical strictness the middle term
only by which the particular conclusion is connected with the general
statement. But when the <i>reasoning</i> is not in strict logical
form, the middle term following the conclusion is called the <i>reason</i>;
thus in the statement "All tyrants deserve death; C&aelig;sar was a
tyrant; Therefore C&aelig;sar deserved death," "C&aelig;sar was a tyrant"
would in the strictest sense be called the <i>argument</i>; but if we say
"C&aelig;sar deserved death because he was a tyrant," the latter clause
would be termed the <i>reason</i>. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#CAUSE">CAUSE</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#REASON_v">REASON</a></span>, <i>v.</i>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#MIND">MIND</a></span>;

<p><i>Argumentation</i> and <i>debate</i>, in the ordinary use of the words,
suppose two parties alleging reasons for and against a proposition;
the same idea appears figuratively when we speak of a
<i>debate</i> or an <i>argument</i> with oneself, or of a <i>debate</i> between reason
and conscience. <i>Reasoning</i> may be the act of one alone, as it is
simply the orderly setting forth of reasons, whether for the instruction
of inquirers, the confuting of opponents, or the clear
establishment of truth for oneself. <i>Reasoning</i> may be either
deductive or inductive. <i>Argument</i> or <i>argumentation</i> was formerly
used of deductive <i>reasoning</i> only. With the rise of the
inductive philosophy these words have come to be applied to
inductive processes also; but while <i>reasoning</i> may be informal or
even (as far as tracing its processes is concerned) unconscious,
<i>argument</i> and <i>argumentation</i> strictly imply logical form. <i>Reasoning</i>,
as denoting a process, is a broader term than <i>reason</i> or
<i>argument</i>; many <i>arguments</i> or <i>reasons</i> may be included in a
single chain of <i>reasoning</i>.</p>

resist control or adaptation to human use. <i>Ungovernable</i> applies
to that which successfully defies authority and power; <i>unmanageable</i>
to that which resists the utmost exercise of skill or of
skill and power combined; <i>rebellious</i>, to that which is defiant of
authority, whether successfully or unsuccessfully; <i>seditious</i>, to
that which partakes of or tends to excite a <i>rebellious</i> spirit, <i>seditious</i>
suggesting more of covert plan, scheming, or conspiracy,
<i>rebellious</i> more of overt act or open violence. While the <i>unmanageable</i>
or <i>ungovernable</i> defies control, the <i>rebellious</i> or
<i>seditious</i> may be forced to submission; as, the man has an <i>ungovernable</i>
temper; the horses became <i>unmanageable</i>; he tamed
his <i>rebellious</i> spirit. <i>Insubordinate</i> applies to the disposition to
resist and resent control as such; <i>mutinous</i>, to open defiance of
authority, especially in the army, navy, or merchant marine. A
<i>contumacious</i> act or spirit is contemptuous as well as defiant.

<p>A <i>memorial</i> is any object, whether a writing, a monument, or
other permanent thing that is designed or adapted to keep something

applying to any writing, mark, or trace that serves as a <i>memorial</i>
giving enduring attestation of an event or fact; an extended <i>account</i>,
<i>chronicle</i>, or <i>history</i> is a <i>record</i>; so, too, may be a brief

<p><i>Civilization</i> applies to nations, denoting the sum of those civil,
social, economic, and political attainments by which a community
is removed from barbarism; a people may be civilized while still
far from <i>refinement</i> or <i>culture</i>, but <i>civilization</i> is susceptible of
various degrees and of continued progress. <i>Refinement</i> applies
either to nations or individuals, denoting the removal of what is
coarse and rude, and a corresponding attainment of what is delicate,
elegant, and beautiful. <i>Cultivation</i>, denoting primarily the
process of cultivating the soil or growing crops, then the improved
condition of either which is the result, is applied in similar sense
to the human mind and character, but in this usage is now largely
superseded by the term <i>culture</i>, which denotes a high development<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
of the best qualities of man's mental and spiritual nature,
with especial reference to the esthetic faculties and to graces of
speech and manner, regarded as the expression of a refined nature.
<i>Culture</i> in the fullest sense denotes that degree of <i>refinement</i> and
development which results from continued <i>cultivation</i> through successive
generations; a man's faculties may be brought to a high
degree of <i>cultivation</i> in some specialty, while he himself remains
uncultured even to the extent of coarseness and rudeness. Compare

accusations and charges, but to arguments or opinions. <i>Refute</i> is

<h3>RELIABLE.</h3>

<h4>Synonyms:</h4>

<table class="tbs" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>trustworthy,</td><td>trusty.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The word <i>reliable</i> has been sharply challenged, but seems to
have established its place in the language. The objection to its
use on the ground that the suffix <i>-able</i> can not properly be added
to an intransitive verb is answered by the citation of such words as
"available," "conversable," "laughable," and the like, while, in the
matter of usage, <i>reliable</i> has the authority of Coleridge, Martineau,
Mill, Irving, Newman, Gladstone, and others of the foremost of
recent English writers. The objection to the application of <i>reliable</i>
to persons is not sustained by the use of the verb "rely," which
is applied to persons in the authorized version of the Scriptures, in
the writings of Shakespeare and Bacon, and in the usage of good
speakers and writers. <i>Trusty</i> and <i>trustworthy</i> refer to inherent
qualities of a high order, <i>trustworthy</i> being especially applied to
persons, and denoting moral integrity and truthfulness; we speak<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
of a <i>trusty</i> sword, a <i>trusty</i> servant; we say the man is thoroughly
<i>trustworthy</i>. <i>Reliable</i> is inferior in meaning, denoting merely
the possession of such qualities as are needed for safe reliance; as,
a <i>reliable</i> pledge; <i>reliable</i> information. A man is said to be <i>reliable</i>
with reference not only to moral qualities, but to judgment,
knowledge, skill, habit, or perhaps pecuniary ability; a thoroughly
<i>trustworthy</i> person might not be <i>reliable</i> as a witness on account
of unconscious sympathy, or as a security by reason of insufficient
means. A <i>reliable</i> messenger is one who may be depended on to
do his errand correctly and promptly; a <i>trusty</i> or <i>trustworthy</i>
messenger is one who may be admitted to knowledge of the views
and purposes of those who employ him, and who will be faithful
beyond the mere letter of his commission. We can speak of a
railroad-train as <i>reliable</i> when it can be depended on to arrive on
time; but to speak of a <i>reliable</i> friend would be cold, and to speak
of a warrior girding on his <i>reliable</i> sword would be ludicrous.</p>

<p><i>Piety</i> is primarily filial duty, as of children to parents, and
hence, in its highest sense, a loving obedience and service to God

both in heart and in act of a divine being. <i>Religion</i>, in the fullest
and highest sense, includes all the other words of this group. <i>Worship</i>
may be external and formal, or it may be the adoring reverence
of the human spirit for the divine, seeking outward expression.
<i>Devotion</i>, which in its fullest sense is self-consecration, is
often used to denote an act of <i>worship</i>, especially prayer or adoration;
as, he is engaged in his <i>devotions</i>. <i>Morality</i> is the system
and practise of duty as required by the moral law, consisting
chiefly in outward acts, and thus may be observed without spiritual
rectitude of heart; <i>morality</i> is of necessity included in all
true <i>religion</i>, which involves both outward act and spiritual service.
<i>Godliness</i> (primarily godlikeness) is a character and spirit
like that of God. <i>Holiness</i> is the highest, sinless perfection of
any spirit, whether divine or human, tho often used for purity or
for consecration. <i>Theology</i> is the science of <i>religion</i>, or the study
and scientific statement of all that the human mind can know of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
God. <i>Faith</i>, strictly the belief and trust which the soul exercises

<i>Mangle</i> is a stronger word than <i>lacerate</i>; <i>lacerate</i> is more superficial,
<i>mangle</i> more complete. To <i>burst</i> or <i>rupture</i> is to <i>tear</i> or

one is not ready to maintain; as, to <i>retract</i> a charge or accusation;
one <i>recants</i> what was especially his own, he <i>retracts</i> what was directed<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>

mother could not <i>deny</i> him what he desired. To <i>discard</i> is to cast
away as useless or worthless; thus, one <i>discards</i> a worn garment;
a coquette <i>discards</i> a lover. <i>Revoke</i> (L. <i>re</i>, back, and <i>voco</i>, call),
etymologically the exact equivalent of the English <i>recall</i>, is to
take back something given or granted; as, to <i>revoke</i> a command,
a will, or a grant; <i>recall</i> may be used in the exact sense of <i>revoke</i>,
but is often applied to persons, as <i>revoke</i> is not; we <i>recall</i> a messenger
and <i>revoke</i> the order with which he was charged. <i>Abjure</i>
(L. <i>ab</i>, away, and <i>juro</i>, swear) is etymologically the exact equivalent
of the Saxon <i>forswear</i>, signifying to put away formally and
under oath, as an error, heresy, or evil practise, or a condemned
and detested person. A man <i>abjures</i> his religion, <i>recants</i> his
belief, <i>abjures</i> or <i>renounces</i> his allegiance, <i>repudiates</i> another's
claim, <i>renounces</i> his own, <i>retracts</i> a false statement. A person

<p><i>Account</i> carries the idea of a commercial summary. A <i>statement</i>
is definite, confined to essentials and properly to matters
within the personal knowledge of the one who states them; as, an
ante-mortem <i>statement</i>. A <i>narrative</i> is a somewhat extended
and embellished <i>account</i> of events in order of time, ordinarily with
a view to please or entertain. A <i>description</i> gives especial scope
to the pictorial element. A <i>report</i> (L. <i>re</i>, back, and <i>porto</i>, bring),
as its etymology implies, is something brought back, as by one
sent to obtain information, and may be concise and formal or

<p><i>Blame</i>, <i>censure</i>, and <i>disapproval</i> may either be felt or uttered;
<i>comment</i>, <i>criticism</i>, <i>rebuke</i>, <i>reflection</i>, <i>reprehension</i>, and <i>reproof</i>
are always expressed. The same is true of <i>admonition</i> and <i>animadversion</i>.
<i>Comment</i> and <i>criticism</i> may be favorable as well as
censorious; they imply no superiority or authority on the part of
him who utters them; nor do <i>reflection</i> or <i>reprehension</i>, which<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
are simply turning the mind back upon what is disapproved. <i>Reprehension</i>
is supposed to be calm and just, and with good intent;
it is therefore a serious matter, however mild, and is capable of
great force, as expressed in the phrase severe <i>reprehension</i>. <i>Reflection</i>
is often from mere ill feeling, and is likely to be more personal
and less impartial than <i>reprehension</i>; we often speak of
unkind or unjust <i>reflections</i>. <i>Rebuke</i>, literally a stopping of the
mouth, is administered to a forward or hasty person; <i>reproof</i> is
administered to one intentionally or deliberately wrong; both
words imply authority in the reprover, and direct expression of
<i>disapproval</i> to the face of the person <i>rebuked</i> or <i>reproved</i>. <i>Reprimand</i>
is official <i>censure</i> formally administered by a superior to
one under his command. <i>Animadversion</i> is <i>censure</i> of a high,
authoritative, and somewhat formal kind. <i>Rebuke</i> may be given
at the outset, or in the midst of an action; <i>animadversion</i>, <i>reflection</i>,
<i>reprehension</i>, <i>reproof</i>, always follow the act; <i>admonition</i> is
anticipatory, and meant to be preventive. <i>Check</i> is allied to <i>rebuke</i>,
and given before or during action; <i>chiding</i> is nearer to <i>reproof</i>,
but with more of personal bitterness and less of authority.

<i>reproved</i>; to <i>rebuke</i> is to <i>reprove</i> with sharpness, and often with

deemed censurable; to <i>reprimand</i> is to <i>reprove</i> officially; to

answerable, as for a fault; <i>blame</i> and <i>censure</i> apply either to persons
or acts; <i>reprove</i> and <i>rebuke</i> are applied chiefly, and <i>reprimand</i>
exclusively to persons. To <i>reproach</i> is to <i>censure</i> openly and
vehemently, and with intense personal feeling as of grief or anger;
as, to <i>reproach</i> one for ingratitude; <i>reproach</i> knows no distinction<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
of rank or character; a subject may <i>reproach</i> a king or a
criminal judge. To <i>expostulate</i> or <i>remonstrate with</i> is to mingle
reasoning and appeal with <i>censure</i> in the hope of winning one from
his evil way, <i>expostulate</i> being the gentler, <i>remonstrate</i> the severer
word. <i>Admonish</i> is the mildest of <i>reproving</i> words, and may
even be used of giving a caution or warning where no wrong is implied,
or of simply reminding of duty which might be forgotten.
<i>Censure</i>, <i>rebuke</i>, and <i>reprove</i> apply to wrong that has been done;
<i>warn</i> and <i>admonish</i> refer to anticipated error or fault. When

<p>To <i>repay</i> or to <i>retaliate</i>, to <i>punish</i> or to <i>reward</i>, may be to

oneself of all obligation of favor or hostility, of punishment or <i>reward</i>.
<i>Requite</i> is often used in the more general sense of <i>recompense</i>
or <i>repay</i>, but always with the suggestion, at least, of the
original idea of full equivalent; when one speaks of <i>requiting</i>
kindness with ingratitude, the expression gains force from the
comparison of the actual with the proper and appropriate <i>return</i>.

especially of wearying or painful activity. <i>Recreation</i> is some
pleasing activity of certain organs or faculties that affords <i>rest</i> to
other parts of our nature that have become weary. <i>Repose</i> is
a laying down, primarily of the body, and figuratively a similar
freedom from toil or strain of mind. <i>Repose</i> is more complete
than <i>rest</i>; a <i>pause</i> is a momentary <i>cessation</i> of activity; a black-smith

of mind, soul, conscience, is not mere <i>cessation</i> of activity, but a

<p><i>Balky</i>, <i>mulish</i>, <i>obstinate</i>, and <i>stubborn</i> are synonyms of <i>restive</i>
only in an infrequent if not obsolete use; the supposed sense of
"tending to rest," "standing stubbornly still," is scarcely supported
by any examples, and those cited to support that meaning often
fail to do so. The disposition to offer active resistance to control
by any means whatever is what is commonly indicated by <i>restive</i>
in the best English speech and literature. Dryden speaks of "the
pampered colt" as "<i>restiff</i> to the rein;" but the rein is not used
to propel a horse forward, but to hold him in, and it is against this
that he is "<i>restiff</i>." A horse may be made <i>restless</i> by flies or by
martial music, but with no refractoriness; the <i>restive</i> animal impatiently
resists or struggles to break from control, as by bolting,
flinging his rider, or otherwise. With this the metaphorical use
of the word agrees, which is always in the sense of such terms as
<i>impatient</i>, <i>intractable</i>, <i>rebellious</i>, and the like; a people <i>restive</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
under despotism are not disposed to "rest" under it, but to resist
it and fling it off.</p>

from an action. <i>Constrain</i> refers almost exclusively to
moral force, <i>restrain</i> frequently to physical force, as when we
speak of putting one under restraint. To <i>restrain</i> an action is to
hold it partially or wholly in check, so that it is under pressure
even while it acts; to <i>restrict</i> an action is to fix a limit or boundary
which it may not pass, but within which it is free. To <i>repress</i>,
literally to press back, is to hold in check, and perhaps only temporarily,
that which is still very active; it is a feebler word than

more the personal injury in return for which it is inflicted, <i>vengeance</i>
the ill desert of those upon whom it is inflicted. A <i>requital</i>

<p>The essential idea of <i>revolution</i> is a change in the form of government
or constitution, or a change of rulers, otherwise than as
provided by the laws of succession, election, etc.; while such
change is apt to involve armed hostilities, these make no necessary
part of the <i>revolution</i>. The <i>revolution</i> by which Dom Pedro was
dethroned, and Brazil changed from an empire to a republic, was
accomplished without a battle, and almost without a shot. <i>Anarchy</i>
refers to the condition of a state when human government
is superseded or destroyed by factions or other causes. <i>Lawlessness</i>
is a temper of mind or condition of the community which
may result in <i>anarchy</i>. <i>Confusion</i>, <i>disorder</i>, <i>riot</i>, and <i>tumult</i> are
incidental and temporary outbreaks of <i>lawlessness</i>, but may not be
<i>anarchy</i>. <i>Insubordination</i> is individual disobedience. <i>Sedition</i>
is the plotting, <i>rebellion</i> the fighting, against the existing government,
but always with the purpose of establishing some other
government in its place. When <i>rebellion</i> is successful it is called
<i>revolution</i>; but there may be <i>revolution</i> without <i>rebellion</i>; as,
the English <i>Revolution</i> of 1688. A <i>revolt</i> is an uprising against
existing authority without the comprehensive views of change in
the form or administration of government that are involved in
<i>revolution</i>. <i>Anarchy</i>, when more than temporary <i>disorder</i>, is a
proposed <i>disintegration</i> of society, in which it is imagined that
social order might exist without government. Slaves make <i>insurrection</i>;
soldiers or sailors break out in <i>mutiny</i>; subject provinces

<p>Any round body <i>rolls</i> which continuously touches with successive

a wagon-wheel <i>rolls</i> along the ground. To <i>rotate</i> is said of a body
that has a circular motion about its own center or axis; to <i>revolve</i>
is said of a body that moves in a curving path, as a circle or an
ellipse, about a center outside of itself, so as to return periodically
to the same relative position that it held at some previous
time. A <i>revolving</i> body may also either <i>rotate</i> or <i>roll</i> at the same
time; the earth <i>revolves</i> around the sun, and <i>rotates</i> on its own
axis; in popular usage, the earth is often said to <i>revolve</i> about its
own axis, or to have a daily "revolution," but <i>rotate</i> and "rotation"
are the more accurate terms. A cylinder over which an endless
belt is drawn is said to <i>roll</i> as regards the belt, tho it <i>rotates</i> as
regards its own axis. Any object that is in contact with or connected
with a <i>rolling</i> body is often said to <i>roll</i>; as, the car <i>rolls</i>
smoothly along the track. Objects whose motion approximates or
suggests a rotary motion along a supporting surface are also said
to <i>roll</i>; as, ocean waves <i>roll</i> in upon the shore, or the ship <i>rolls</i> in
the trough of the sea. <i>Turn</i> is a conversational and popular
word often used vaguely for <i>rotate</i> or <i>revolve</i>, or for any motion
about a fixed point, especially for a motion less than a complete
"rotation" or "revolution;" a man <i>turns</i> his head or <i>turns</i> on his

<p>A <i>right</i> is that which one may properly demand upon considerations

individual and special, and often artificial, as the <i>right</i> of inheritance
by primogeniture. A <i>privilege</i> is always special, exceptional,
and artificial; it is something not enjoyed by all, or only to be
enjoyed on certain special conditions, a peculiar benefit, favor,
advantage, etc. A <i>privilege</i> may be of doing or avoiding; in the
latter case it is an <i>exemption</i> or <i>immunity</i>; as, a <i>privilege</i> of
hunting or fishing; <i>exemption</i> from military service; <i>immunity</i>
from arrest. A <i>franchise</i> is a specific <i>right</i> or <i>privilege</i> granted
by the government or established as such by governmental authority;
as, the elective <i>franchise</i>; a railroad <i>franchise</i>. A <i>prerogative</i>
is an official <i>right</i> or <i>privilege</i>, especially one inherent in the
royal or sovereign power; in a wider sense it is an exclusive and
peculiar <i>privilege</i> which one possesses by reason of being what he
is; as, reason is the <i>prerogative</i> of man; kings and nobles have

<p>To <i>rise</i> is to move up or upward whether slowly or quickly,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
whether through the least or greatest distance; the waves <i>rise</i>;
the mists <i>rise</i>; the river <i>rises</i> after heavy rains; as said of persons,
to <i>rise</i> is to come to an erect position after kneeling, sitting, reclining,
or lying down; as, to <i>rise</i> from a sick-bed; my friend <i>rose</i>
as I entered; the guests <i>rose</i> to depart; so a deliberative assembly
or a committee is said to <i>rise</i> when it breaks up a session; a sun
or star <i>rises</i> when to our apprehension it comes above the horizon
and begins to go up the sky. To <i>ascend</i> is to go far upward, and
is often used in a stately sense; as, Christ <i>ascended</i> to heaven.
The shorter form <i>rise</i> is now generally preferred to the longer
form <i>arise</i>, except in poetic or elevated style. The sun <i>rises</i> or

<p><i>Royal</i> denotes that which actually belongs or pertains to a

<i>royal</i> raiment that which the king wears. <i>Regal</i> denotes that
which in outward state is appropriate for a king; a subject may

<i>Kingly</i> denotes that which is worthy of a king in personal qualities,<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
especially of character and conduct; as, a <i>kingly</i> bearing; a
<i>kingly</i> resolve. <i>Princely</i> is especially used of treasure, expenditure,
gifts, etc., as <i>princely</i> munificence, a <i>princely</i> fortune,
where <i>regal</i> could not so well be used and <i>royal</i> would change the
sense. The distinctions between these words are not absolute, but
the tendency of the best usage is as here suggested.</p>

<p><i>Rural</i> and <i>rustic</i> are alike derived from the Latin <i>rus</i>, country,
and may be alike defined as pertaining to, characteristic of,
or dwelling in the country; but in usage <i>rural</i> refers especially
to scenes or objects in the country, considered as the work of
nature; <i>rustic</i> refers to their effect upon man or to their condition
as affected by human agency; as, a <i>rural</i> scene; a <i>rustic</i>
party; a <i>rustic</i> lass. We speak, however, of the <i>rural</i> population,
<i>rural</i> simplicity, etc. <i>Rural</i> has always a favorable sense;
<i>rustic</i> frequently an unfavorable one, as denoting a lack of culture
and refinement; thus, <i>rustic</i> politeness expresses that which is
well-meant, but awkward; similar ideas are suggested by a <i>rustic</i>
feast, <i>rustic</i> garb, etc. <i>Rustic</i> is, however, often used of a studied
simplicity, an artistic rudeness, which is pleasing and perhaps
beautiful; as, a <i>rustic</i> cottage; a <i>rustic</i> chair. <i>Pastoral</i> refers
to the care of flocks, and to the shepherd's life with the pleasing
associations suggested by the old poetic ideal of that life; as,
<i>pastoral</i> poetry. <i>Bucolic</i> is kindred to <i>pastoral</i>, but is a less
elevated term, and sometimes slightly contemptuous.</p>

<p>Any religious act, especially a public act, viewed as a means<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
of serving God is called a <i>service</i>; the word commonly includes
the entire series of exercises of a single occasion of public worship.
A religious <i>service</i> ordained as an outward and visible sign of an
inward and spiritual grace is called a <i>sacrament</i>. <i>Ceremony</i> is
a form expressing reverence, or at least respect; we may speak of
religious <i>ceremonies</i>, the <i>ceremonies</i> of polite society, the <i>ceremonies</i>
of a coronation, an inauguration, etc. An <i>observance</i> has
more than a formal obligation, reaching or approaching a religious
sacredness; a stated religious <i>observance</i>, viewed as established
by authority, is called an <i>ordinance</i>; viewed as an established
custom, it is a <i>rite</i>. The terms <i>sacrament</i> and <i>ordinance</i>,
in the religious sense, are often used interchangeably; the <i>ordinance</i>
derives its sacredness from the authority that ordained it,
while the <i>sacrament</i> possesses a sacredness due to something in
itself, even when viewed simply as a representation or memorial.
The Lord's Supper is the Scriptural name for the <i>observance</i> commemorating
the death of Christ; the word <i>communion</i> is once
applied to it (<i>1 Cor.</i> x, 16), but not as a distinctive name; at an
early period, however, the name <i>communion</i> was so applied, as
denoting the communing of Christians with their Lord, or with
one another. The term <i>eucharist</i> describes the Lord's Supper as a
thanksgiving <i>service</i>; it is also called by preeminence <i>the sacrament</i>,
as the ratifying of a solemn vow of consecration to Christ.</p>

<p><i>Sagacious</i> refers to a power of tracing the hidden or recondite

to mere keenness of sense-perception. We do not call a
hound <i>sagacious</i> in following a clear trail; but if he loses the
scent, as at the edge of a stream, and circles around till he strikes
it again, his conduct is said to be <i>sagacious</i>. In human affairs
<i>sagacious</i> refers to a power of ready, far-reaching, and accurate
inference from observed facts perhaps in themselves very slight,
that seems like a special sense; or to a similar readiness to foresee
the results of any action, especially upon human motives or conduct&mdash;a
kind of prophetic common sense. <i>Sagacious</i> is a broader<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
and nobler word than <i>shrewd</i>, and not capable of the invidious
sense which the latter word often bears; on the other hand, <i>sagacious</i>
is less lofty and comprehensive than <i>wise</i> in its full sense,
and more limited to matters of direct practical moment. Compare

</table>

<p>A <i>bargain</i> is strictly an agreement or contract to buy and sell,
tho the word is often used to denote the entire transaction and also
as a designation for the thing sold or purchased. <i>Change</i> and
<i>exchange</i> are words of wider signification, applying only incidentally
to the transfer of property or value; a <i>change</i> secures something
different in any way or by any means; an <i>exchange</i> secures
something as an equivalent or return, tho not necessarily as payment
for what is given. <i>Barter</i> is the <i>exchange</i> of one commodity
for another, the word being used generally with reference to portable
commodities. <i>Trade</i> in the broad sense may apply to vast
businesses (as the book-<i>trade</i>), but as denoting a single transaction
is used chiefly in regard to things of moderate value, when it
becomes nearly synonymous with <i>barter</i>. <i>Sale</i> is commonly, and
with increasing strictness, limited to the transfer of property for
money, or for something estimated at a money value or considered
as equivalent to so much money in hand or to be paid. A <i>deal</i>
in the political sense is a <i>bargain</i>, substitution, or transfer for the
benefit of certain persons or parties against all others; as, the
nomination was the result of a <i>deal</i>; in business it may have a
similar meaning, but it frequently signifies simply a <i>sale</i> or <i>exchange</i>,
a dealing; as, a heavy <i>deal</i> in stocks.</p>

fully as for a time to extinguish it. To <i>cloy</i> or <i>surfeit</i> is to
gratify to the point of revulsion or disgust. <i>Glut</i> is a strong
but somewhat coarse word applied to the utmost satisfaction of
vehement appetites and passions; as, to <i>glut</i> a vengeful spirit
with slaughter; we speak of <i>glutting</i> the market with a supply
so excessive as to extinguish the demand. Much less than is
needed to <i>satisfy</i> may <i>suffice</i> a frugal or abstemious person;

<p>The primary sense of a <i>scholar</i> is one who is being schooled;
thence the word passes to denote one who is apt in school work,
and finally one who is thoroughly schooled, master of what the
schools can teach, an erudite, accomplished person: when used
without qualification, the word is generally understood in this latter
sense; as, he is manifestly a <i>scholar</i>. <i>Pupil</i> signifies one
under the close personal supervision or instruction of a teacher or
tutor. Those under instruction in schools below the academic<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
grade are technically and officially termed <i>pupils</i>. The word
<i>pupil</i> is uniformly so used in the Reports of the Commissioner of
Education of the United States, but popular American usage prefers
<i>scholar</i> in the original sense; as, teachers and <i>scholars</i> enjoyed
a holiday. Those under instruction in Sunday-schools are
uniformly designated as Sunday-school <i>scholars</i>. <i>Student</i> is applied
to those in the higher grades or courses of study, as the academic,
collegiate, scientific, etc. <i>Student</i> suggests less proficiency
than <i>scholar</i> in the highest sense, the <i>student</i> being one who is
learning, the <i>scholar</i> one who has learned. On the other hand,
<i>student</i> suggests less of personal supervision than <i>pupil</i>; thus, the
college <i>student</i> often becomes the private <i>pupil</i> of some instructor
in special studies. For <i>disciple</i>, etc., compare synonyms for <span class="smcl"><a href="#ADHERENT">ADHERENT</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge</i> of a single fact, not known as related to any other,
or of many facts not known as having any mutual relations or as
comprehended under any general law, does not reach the meaning
of <i>science</i>; <i>science</i> is <i>knowledge</i> reduced to law and embodied
in system. The <i>knowledge</i> of various countries gathered by an
observant traveler may be a heterogeneous medley of facts, which
gain real value only when coordinated and arranged by the man of
<i>science</i>. <i>Art</i> always relates to something to be done, <i>science</i> to
something to be known. Not only must <i>art</i> be discriminated
from <i>science</i>, but <i>art</i> in the industrial or mechanical sense must
be distinguished from <i>art</i> in the esthetic sense; the former aims
chiefly at utility, the latter at beauty. The mechanic <i>arts</i> are the
province of the artisan, the esthetic or fine <i>arts</i> are the province
of the artist; all the industrial <i>arts</i>, as of weaving or printing,
arithmetic or navigation, are governed by exact rules. <i>Art</i> in
the highest esthetic sense, while it makes use of rules, transcends
all rule; no rules can be given for the production of a painting
like Raffael's "Transfiguration," a statue like the Apollo Belvedere,
or a poem like the Iliad. <i>Science</i> does not, like the
mechanic <i>arts</i>, make production its direct aim, yet its possible
productive application in the <i>arts</i> is a constant stimulus to scientific<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
investigation; the <i>science</i>, as in the case of chemistry or electricity,
is urged on to higher development by the demands of the
<i>art</i>, while the <i>art</i> is perfected by the advance of the <i>science</i>.
Creative <i>art</i> seeking beauty for its own sake is closely akin to

<p>The first four words agree in denoting something given or deposited

An <i>earnest</i> is of the same kind as that to be given, a portion of it
delivered in advance, as when part of the purchase-money is paid,
according to the common expression, "to bind the bargain." A
<i>pledge</i> or <i>security</i> may be wholly different in kind from that to be
given or paid, and may greatly exceed it in value. <i>Security</i> may
be of real or personal property&mdash;anything of sufficient value to
make the creditor secure; a <i>pledge</i> is always of personal property
or chattels. Every pawnshop contains unredeemed <i>pledges</i>;
land, merchandise, bonds, etc., are frequently offered and accepted
as <i>security</i>. A person may become <i>security</i> or <i>surety</i> for another's
payment of a debt, appearance in court, etc.; in the latter case, he
is said to become <i>bail</i> for that person; the person accused gives
<i>bail</i> for himself. <i>Gage</i> survives only as a literary word, chiefly
in certain phrases; as, "the <i>gage</i> of battle."</p>

<p><i>Self-control</i> is holding oneself within due limits in pleasures

pleasures for the sake of duty. <i>Self-renunciation</i> surrenders conscious

anything to surrender. There have been devotees who practised
very little <i>self-denial</i> with very much <i>self-renunciation</i>. A
mother will care for a sick child with complete <i>self-abnegation</i>,
but without a thought of <i>self-denial</i>. <i>Self-devotion</i> is heart-consecration<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
of self to a person or cause with readiness for any needed

</table>

<p>To <i>send</i> is to cause to go or pass from one place to another, and
always in fact or thought away from the agent or agency that controls
the act. <i>Send</i> in its most common use involves personal
agency without personal presence; according to the adage, "If
you want your business done, go; if not, <i>send</i>;" one <i>sends</i> a letter
or a bullet, a messenger or a message. In all the derived uses
this same idea controls; if one <i>sends</i> a ball into his own heart, the
action is away from the directing hand, and he is viewed as the
passive recipient of his own act; it is with an approach to personification
that we speak of the bow <i>sending</i> the arrow, or the gun
the shot. To <i>despatch</i> is to <i>send</i> hastily or very promptly, ordinarily
with a destination in view; to <i>dismiss</i> is to <i>send</i> away from
oneself without reference to a destination; as, to <i>dismiss</i> a clerk,
an application, or an annoying subject. To <i>discharge</i> is to <i>send</i>
away so as to relieve a person or thing of a load; we <i>discharge</i> a
gun or <i>discharge</i> the contents; as applied to persons, <i>discharge</i> is
a harsher term than <i>dismiss</i>. To <i>emit</i> is to <i>send</i> forth from within,
with no reference to a destination; as, the sun <i>emits</i> light and
heat. <i>Transmit</i>, from the Latin, is a dignified term, often less
vigorous than the Saxon <i>send</i>, but preferable at times in literary
or scientific use; as, to <i>transmit</i> the crown, or the feud, from generation
to generation; to <i>transmit</i> a charge of electricity. <i>Transmit</i>
fixes the attention more on the intervening agency, as <i>send</i>
does upon the points of departure and destination.</p>

<p><i>Sensibility</i> in the philosophical sense, denotes the capacity of
emotion or feeling, as distinguished from the intellect and the
will. (Compare synonyms for <span class="smcl"><a href="#SENSATION">SENSATION</a></span>.) In popular use <i>sensibility</i>
denotes sometimes capacity of feeling of any kind; as, <i>sensibility</i>
to heat or cold; sometimes, a peculiar readiness to be the
subject of feeling, especially of the higher feelings; as, the <i>sensibility</i>
of the artist or the poet; a person of great or fine <i>sensibility</i>.
<i>Sensitiveness</i> denotes an especial delicacy of <i>sensibility</i>, ready to
be excited by the slightest cause, as displayed, for instance, in the
"sensitive-plant." <i>Susceptibility</i> is rather a capacity to take up,
receive, and, as it were, to contain feeling, so that a person of great
<i>susceptibility</i> is capable of being not only readily but deeply
moved; <i>sensitiveness</i> is more superficial, <i>susceptibility</i> more pervading.
Thus, in physics, the <i>sensitiveness</i> of a magnetic needle
is the ease with which it may be deflected, as by another magnet;
its <i>susceptibility</i> is the degree to which it can be magnetized by a<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
given magnetic force or the amount of magnetism it will hold. So
a person of great <i>sensitiveness</i> is quickly and keenly affected by
any external influence, as by music, pathos, or ridicule, while a
person of great <i>susceptibility</i> is not only touched, but moved to
his inmost soul.</p>

heavily taxes endurance or resisting power; as, a <i>severe</i> pain,
fever, or winter. <i>Rigid</i> signifies primarily <i>stiff</i>, resisting any effort
to change its shape; a corpse is said to be <i>rigid</i> in death; hence,
in metaphorical sense, a <i>rigid</i> person or character is one that resists
all efforts to change the will or course of conduct; a <i>rigid</i> rule or
statement is one that admits of no deviation. <i>Rigorous</i> is nearly
akin to <i>rigid</i>, but is a stronger word, having reference to action or
active qualities, as <i>rigid</i> does to state or character; a <i>rigid</i> rule
may be <i>rigorously</i> enforced. <i>Strict</i> (L. <i>stringo</i>, bind) signifies
bound or stretched tight, tense, strenuously exact. <i>Stern</i> unites
harshness and authority with strictness or severity; <i>stern</i>, as said
even of inanimate objects, suggests something authoritative or
forbidding. <i>Austere</i> signifies severely simple or temperate, <i>strict</i>
in self-restraint or discipline, and similarly <i>unrelenting</i> toward
others. We speak of <i>austere</i> morality, <i>rigid</i> rules, <i>rigorous</i> discipline,
<i>stern</i> commands, <i>severe</i> punishment, <i>harsh</i> speech or a
<i>harsh</i> voice, <i>hard</i> requirements, <i>strict</i> injunctions, and <i>strict</i> obedience.
<i>Strict</i> discipline holds one exactly and unflinchingly to
the rule; <i>rigorous</i> discipline punishes severely any infraction of
it. The <i>austere</i> character is seldom lovely, but it is always strong
and may be grand, commanding, and estimable.</p>

<p>A thing is <i>shaken</i> which is subjected to short and abruptly
checked movements, as forward and backward, up and down,
from side to side, etc. A tree is "<i>shaken</i> with a mighty wind;"
a man slowly <i>shakes</i> his head. A thing <i>rocks</i> that is sustained
from below; it <i>swings</i> if suspended from above, as a pendulum, or
pivoted at the side, as a crane or a bridge-draw; to <i>oscillate</i> is to
<i>swing</i> with a smooth and regular returning motion; a <i>vibrating</i>
motion may be tremulous or <i>jarring</i>. The pendulum of a clock
may be said to <i>swing</i>, <i>vibrate</i>, or <i>oscillate</i>; a steel bridge <i>vibrates</i>
under the passage of a heavy train; the term <i>vibrate</i> is also applied
to molecular movements. <i>Jolting</i> is a lifting from and letting
down suddenly upon an unyielding surface; as, a carriage
<i>jolts</i> over a rough road. A <i>jarring</i> motion is abruptly and very
rapidly repeated through an exceedingly limited space; the <i>jolting</i>
of the carriage <i>jars</i> the windows. <i>Rattling</i> refers directly to the
sound produced by <i>shaking</i>. To <i>joggle</i> is to <i>shake</i> slightly; as, a
passing touch <i>joggles</i> the desk on which one is writing. A thing
<i>trembles</i> that <i>shakes</i> perceptibly and with an appearance of uncertainty
and instability, as a person under the influence of fear; a
thing <i>shivers</i> when all its particles are stirred with a slight but
pervading tremulous motion, as a human body under the influence
of cold; <i>shuddering</i> is a more pronounced movement of a similar
kind, in human beings often the effect of emotional or moral
recoil; hence, the word is applied by extension to such feelings
even when they have no such outward manifestation; as, one says,
"I <i>shudder</i> at the thought." To <i>quiver</i> is to have slight and often
spasmodic contractile motions, as the flesh under the surgeon's
knife. <i>Thrill</i> is applied to a pervasive movement felt rather than
seen; as, the nerves <i>thrill</i> with delight; <i>quiver</i> is similarly used,
but suggests somewhat more of outward manifestation. To <i>agitate</i>
in its literal use is nearly the same as to <i>shake</i>, tho we speak
of the sea as <i>agitated</i> when we could not say it is <i>shaken</i>; the
Latin <i>agitate</i> is preferred in scientific or technical use to the Saxon
<i>shake</i>, and especially as applied to the action of mechanical contrivances;
in the metaphorical use <i>agitate</i> is more transitory and
superficial, <i>shake</i> more fundamental and enduring; a person's<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
feelings are <i>agitated</i> by distressing news; his courage, his faith,
his credit, or his testimony is <i>shaken</i>. <i>Sway</i> applies to the movement
of a body suspended from above or not firmly sustained from
below, and the motion of which is less pronounced than <i>swinging</i>,
smoother than <i>vibrating</i>, and not necessarily constant as <i>oscillating</i>;
as, the <i>swaying</i> of a reed in the wind. <i>Sway</i> used transitively
especially applies to motions of grace or dignity; <i>brandish</i>
denotes a threatening or hostile motion; a monarch <i>sways</i> the
scepter; the ruffian <i>brandishes</i> a club. To <i>reel</i> or <i>totter</i> always
implies liability to fall; <i>reeling</i> is more violent than <i>swaying</i>, <i>tottering</i>
more irregular; a drunken man <i>reels</i>; we speak of the <i>tottering</i>
step of age or infancy. An extended mass which seems to
lack solidity or cohesion is said to <i>quake</i>; as, a <i>quaking</i> bog.
<i>Quaver</i> is applied almost exclusively to tremulous sounds of the
human voice. <i>Flap</i>, <i>flutter</i>, and <i>fluctuate</i> refer to wave-like
movements, <i>flap</i> generally to such as produce a sharp sound; a
cock <i>flaps</i> his wings; <i>flutter</i> applies to a less pronounced and more
irregular motion; a captive bird or a feeble pulse <i>flutters</i>. Compare

<p>Anything is <i>covered</i> over which something is completely
extended; a vessel is <i>covered</i> with a lid; the head is <i>covered</i> with
a hat. That which <i>covers</i> may also <i>defend</i> or <i>protect</i>; thus, troops
interposed between some portion of their own army and the enemy
are often called a <i>covering</i> party. To <i>shelter</i> is to <i>cover</i> so as to
<i>protect</i> from injury or annoyance; as, the roof <i>shelters</i> from the
storm; woods <i>shelter</i> from the heat. To <i>defend</i> (L. <i>defendere</i>,
to strike away) implies the actual, <i>protect</i> (L. <i>protegere</i>, to
cover before) implies the possible use of force or resisting power;
<i>guard</i> implies sustained vigilance with readiness for conflict; we
<i>defend</i> a person or thing against actual attack; we <i>guard</i> or <i>protect</i>
against possible assault or injury. A powerful person may
<i>protect</i> one who is weak by simply declaring himself his friend;
he <i>defends</i> him by some form of active championship. An inanimate
object may <i>protect</i>, as a garment from cold; <i>defend</i> is used
but rarely, and by somewhat violent metaphor, in such connection.
<i>Protect</i> is more complete than <i>guard</i> or <i>defend</i>; an object
may be faithfully <i>guarded</i> or bravely <i>defended</i> in vain, but that
which is <i>protected</i> is secure. To <i>shield</i> is to interpose something<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
over or before that which is assailed, so as to save from harm, and
has a comparatively passive sense; one may <i>guard</i> another by
standing armed at his side, <i>defend</i> him by fighting for him, or
<i>shield</i> him from a missile or a blow by interposing his own person.

arbitrary; thus, a blush may be a <i>sign</i> of shame; the footprint of
an animal is a <i>sign</i> that it has passed; the <i>sign</i> of a business
house now usually declares what is done or kept within, but formerly
might be an object having no connection with the business,
as "the <i>sign</i> of the trout;" the letters of the alphabet are
<i>signs</i> of certain sounds. While a <i>sign</i> may be involuntary, and
even unconscious, a <i>signal</i> is always voluntary, and is usually
concerted; a ship may show <i>signs</i> of distress to the casual observer,
but <i>signals</i> of distress are a distinct appeal for aid. A
<i>symptom</i> is a vital phenomenon resulting from a diseased condition;
in medical language a <i>sign</i> is an <i>indication</i> of any physical

<p><i>Sin</i> is any lack of holiness, any defect of moral purity and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
truth, whether in heart or life, whether of commission or omission.
"All <i>unrighteousness</i> is <i>sin</i>," <i>1 John</i> v, 17. <i>Transgression</i>, as its
etymology indicates, is the stepping over a specific enactment,
whether of God or man, ordinarily by overt act, but in the broadest
sense, in volition or desire. <i>Sin</i> may be either act or state;
<i>transgression</i> is always an act, mental or physical. <i>Crime</i> is often
used for a flagrant violation of right, but in the technical sense
denotes specific violation of human law. <i>Guilt</i> is desert of and
exposure to punishment because of <i>sin</i>. <i>Depravity</i> denotes not any
action, but a perverted moral condition from which any act of <i>sin</i>
may proceed. <i>Sin</i> in the generic sense, as denoting a state of
heart, is synonymous with <i>depravity</i>; in the specific sense, as in
the expression a <i>sin</i>, the term may be synonymous with <i>transgression</i>,
<i>crime</i>, <i>offense</i>, <i>misdeed</i>, etc., or may denote some moral
activity that could not be characterized by terms so positive. <i>Immorality</i>
denotes outward violation of the moral law. <i>Sin</i> is thus
the broadest word, and <i>immorality</i> next in scope; all <i>crimes</i>,
properly so called, and all <i>immoralities</i>, are <i>sins</i>; but there may
be <i>sin</i>, as ingratitude, which is neither <i>crime</i>, <i>transgression</i>, nor
<i>immorality</i>; and there may be <i>immorality</i> which is not <i>crime</i>, as
falsehood. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#CRIMINAL">CRIMINAL</a></span>.</p>

<p>To <i>sing</i> is primarily and ordinarily to utter a succession of
articulate musical sounds with the human voice. The word has
come to include any succession of musical sounds; we say the
bird or the rivulet <i>sings</i>; we speak of "the <i>singing</i> quality" of an
instrument, and by still wider extension of meaning we say the
teakettle or the cricket <i>sings</i>. To <i>chant</i> is to <i>sing</i> in solemn and
somewhat uniform cadence; <i>chant</i> is ordinarily applied to non-metrical
religious compositions. To <i>carol</i> is to <i>sing</i> joyously, and
to <i>warble</i> (kindred with <i>whirl</i>) is to <i>sing</i> with trills or quavers,
usually also with the idea of joy. <i>Carol</i> and <i>warble</i> are especially
applied to the <i>singing</i> of birds. To <i>chirp</i> is to utter a brief musical
sound, perhaps often repeated in the same key, as by certain<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
small birds, insects, etc. To <i>chirrup</i> is to utter a somewhat similar
sound; the word is often used of a brief, sharp sound uttered
as a signal to animate or rouse a horse or other animal. To <i>hum</i>
is to utter murmuring sounds with somewhat monotonous musical
cadence, usually with closed lips; we speak also of the <i>hum</i> of
machinery, etc.</p>

the <i>unbeliever</i> (in the common acceptation) with indifference
or with opposition of heart as well as of intellect. <i>Infidel</i> is an
opprobrious term that might once almost have been said to be
geographical in its range. The Crusaders called all Mohammedans
<i>infidels</i>, and were so called by them in return; the word is commonly
applied to any decided opponent of an accepted religion.
The <i>atheist</i> denies that there is a God; the <i>deist</i> admits the existence
of God, but denies that the Christian Scriptures are a revelation
from him; the <i>agnostic</i> denies either that we do know
or that we can know whether there is a God.</p>

<p>A <i>sketch</i> is a rough, suggestive presentation of anything,
whether graphic or literary, commonly intended to be preliminary<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
to a more complete or extended treatment. An <i>outline</i> gives only
the bounding or determining lines of a figure or a scene; a <i>sketch</i>
may give not only lines, but shading and color, but is hasty and
incomplete. The lines of a <i>sketch</i> are seldom so full and continuous
as those of an <i>outline</i>, being, like the shading or color, little
more than indications or suggestions according to which a finished
<i>picture</i> may be made; the artist's first representation of a sunset,
the hues of which change so rapidly, must of necessity be a <i>sketch</i>.
<i>Draft</i> and <i>plan</i> apply especially to mechanical drawing, of which
<i>outline</i>, <i>sketch</i>, and <i>drawing</i> are also used; a <i>plan</i> is strictly a
view from above, as of a building or machine, giving the lines of
a horizontal section, originally at the level of the ground, now in
a wider sense at any height; as, a <i>plan</i> of the cellar; a <i>plan</i> of
the attic. A mechanical <i>drawing</i> is always understood to be in
full detail; a <i>draft</i> is an incomplete or unfinished <i>drawing</i>; a
<i>design</i> is such a preliminary <i>sketch</i> as indicates the object to be
accomplished or the result to be attained, and is understood to be
original. One may make a <i>drawing</i> of any well-known mechanism,
or a <i>drawing</i> from another man's <i>design</i>; but if he says, "The
<i>design</i> is mine," he claims it as his own invention or composition.
In written composition an <i>outline</i> gives simply the main
divisions, and in the case of a sermon is often called a <i>skeleton</i>; a
somewhat fuller suggestion of illustration, treatment, and style is
given in a <i>sketch</i>. A lawyer's <i>brief</i> is a succinct statement of the
main facts involved in a case, and of the main heads of his argument
on points of law, with reference to authorities cited; the
<i>brief</i> has none of the vagueness of a <i>sketch</i>, being sufficiently exact
and complete to form, on occasion, the basis for the decision of
the court without oral argument, when the case is said to be "submitted
on <i>brief</i>." Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#DESIGN">DESIGN</a></span>.</p>

<h4>Synonyms:</h4>

<table class="tbs" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>noise,</td><td>note,</td><td>tone.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Sound</i> is the sensation produced through the organs of hearing
or the physical cause of this sensation. <i>Sound</i> is the most comprehensive
word of this group, applying to anything that is audible.
<i>Tone</i> is <i>sound</i> considered as having some musical quality or
as expressive of some feeling; <i>noise</i> is <i>sound</i> considered without
reference to musical quality or as distinctly unmusical or discordant.
Thus, in the most general sense <i>noise</i> and <i>sound</i> scarcely
differ, and we say almost indifferently, "I heard a <i>sound</i>," or "I<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
heard a <i>noise</i>." We speak of a fine, musical, or pleasing <i>sound</i>,
but never thus of a <i>noise</i>. In music, <i>tone</i> may denote either a
musical <i>sound</i> or the interval between two such <i>sounds</i>, but in the
most careful usage the latter is now distinguished as the "interval,"
leaving <i>tone</i> to stand only for the <i>sound</i>. <i>Note</i> in music strictly
denotes the character representing a <i>sound</i>, but in loose popular
usage it denotes the <i>sound</i> also, and becomes practically equivalent
to <i>tone</i>. Aside from its musical use, <i>tone</i> is chiefly applied to
that quality of the human voice by which feeling is expressed; as,
he spoke in a cheery <i>tone</i>; the word is similarly applied to the
voices of birds and other animals, and sometimes to inanimate
objects. As used of a musical instrument, <i>tone</i> denotes the general
quality of its sounds collectively considered.</p>

<p>To <i>utter</i> is to give forth as an audible sound, articulate or not.
To <i>talk</i> is to <i>utter</i> a succession of connected words, ordinarily
with the expectation of being listened to. To <i>speak</i> is to give
articulate utterance even to a single word; the officer <i>speaks</i> the

words with the ordinary intonation, as distinguished from singing.
To <i>chat</i> is ordinarily to <i>utter</i> in a familiar, conversational way; to

<h3>SPONTANEOUS.</h3>

<h4>Synonyms:</h4>

<table class="tbs" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>automatic,</td><td>impulsive,</td><td>involuntary,</td><td>voluntary,</td></tr>
<tr><td>free,</td><td>instinctive,</td><td>unbidden,</td><td>willing.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>That is <i>spontaneous</i> which is freely done, with no external
compulsion and, in human actions, without special premeditation
or distinct determination of the will; that is <i>voluntary</i> which is
freely done with distinct act of will; that is <i>involuntary</i> which is
independent of the will, and perhaps in opposition to it; a <i>willing</i>
act is not only in accordance with will, but with desire. Thus
<i>voluntary</i> and <i>involuntary</i>, which are antonyms of each other,
are both partial synonyms of <i>spontaneous</i>. We speak of <i>spontaneous</i>
generation, <i>spontaneous</i> combustion, <i>spontaneous</i> sympathy,
an <i>involuntary</i> start, an <i>unbidden</i> tear, <i>voluntary</i> agreement,
<i>willing</i> submission. A babe's smile in answer to that of its
mother is <i>spontaneous</i>; the smile of a pouting child wheedled into
good humor is <i>involuntary</i>. In physiology the action of the heart
and lungs is called <i>involuntary</i>; the growth of the hair and nails
is <i>spontaneous</i>; the action of swallowing is <i>voluntary</i> up to a
certain point, beyond which it becomes <i>involuntary</i> or <i>automatic</i>.
In the fullest sense of that which is not only without the will but
distinctly in opposition to it, or compulsory, <i>involuntary</i> becomes
an antonym, not only of <i>voluntary</i> but of <i>spontaneous</i>; as, <i>involuntary</i>
servitude. A <i>spontaneous</i> outburst of applause is of
necessity an act of volition, but so completely dependent on sympathetic
impulse that it would seem frigid to call it <i>voluntary</i>,
while to call it <i>involuntary</i> would imply some previous purpose
or inclination not to applaud.</p>

<p>The <i>scout</i> and the <i>spy</i> are both employed to obtain information
of the numbers, movements, etc., of an enemy. The <i>scout</i> lurks on
the outskirts of the hostile army with such concealment as the
case admits of, but without disguise; a <i>spy</i> enters in disguise<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
within the enemy's lines. A <i>scout</i>, if captured, has the rights of
a prisoner of war; a <i>spy</i> is held to have forfeited all rights, and is
liable, in case of capture, to capital punishment. An <i>emissary</i> is
rather political than military; sent rather to secretly influence
opponents than to bring information concerning them; so far as
he does the latter, he is not only an <i>emissary</i>, but a <i>spy</i>.</p>

<h3>STAIN.</h3>

<h4>Synonyms:</h4>

<tr><td>blot,</td><td>discolor,</td><td>dishonor,</td><td>soil,</td><td>sully,</td><td>tinge,</td></tr>
<tr><td>color,</td><td>disgrace,</td><td>dye,</td><td>spot,</td><td>tarnish,</td><td>tint.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To <i>color</i> is to impart a color desired or undesired, temporary or
permanent, or, in the intransitive use, to assume a color in any way;
as, he <i>colored</i> with shame and vexation. To <i>dye</i> is to impart a
color intentionally and with a view to permanence, and especially so
as to pervade the substance or fiber of that to which it is applied.
To <i>stain</i> is primarily to <i>discolor</i>, to impart a color undesired and
perhaps unintended, and which may or may not be permanent.
Thus, a character "<i>dyed</i> in the wool" is one that has received
some early, permanent, and pervading influence; a character
<i>stained</i> with crime or guilt is debased and perverted. <i>Stain</i> is,
however, used of giving an intended and perhaps pleasing color
to wood, glass, etc., by an application of coloring-matter which
enters the substance a little below the surface, in distinction
from painting, in which coloring-matter is spread upon the surface;
<i>dyeing</i> is generally said of wool, yarn, cloth, or similar
materials which are dipped into the <i>coloring</i> liquid. Figuratively,
a standard or a garment may be <i>dyed</i> with blood in honorable
warfare; an assassin's weapon is <i>stained</i> with the blood of his
victim. To <i>tinge</i> is to <i>color</i> slightly, and may also be used of
giving a slight flavor, or a slight admixture of one ingredient or
quality with another that is more pronounced.</p>

</table>

<p>To <i>state</i> (L. <i>sto</i>, stand) is to <i>set forth</i> explicitly, formally, or
particularly in speech or writing. <i>Assert</i> (L. <i>ad</i>, to, and <i>sero</i>, bind)
is strongly personal, signifying to <i>state</i> boldly and positively what<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
the one making the statement has not attempted and may not attempt
to prove. <i>Affirm</i> has less of egotism than <i>assert</i> (as seen in
the word <i>self-assertion</i>), coming nearer to <i>aver</i>. It has more
solemnity than <i>declare</i>, and more composure and dignity than
<i>asseverate</i>, which is to <i>assert</i> excitedly. In legal usage, <i>affirm</i> has
a general agreement with <i>depose</i> and <i>testify</i>; it differs from <i>swear</i>
in not invoking the name of God. To <i>assure</i> is to <i>state</i> with such
authority and confidence as the speaker feels ought to make the
hearer sure. <i>Certify</i> is more formal, and applies rather to written
documents or legal processes. <i>Assure</i>, <i>certify</i>, <i>inform</i>, apply to
the person; <i>affirm</i>, etc., to the thing. <i>Assert</i> is combative; <i>assure</i>
is conciliatory. I <i>assert</i> my right to cross the river; I <i>assure</i> my
friend it is perfectly safe. To <i>aver</i> is to <i>state</i> positively what is
within one's own knowledge or matter of deep conviction. One may
<i>assert</i> himself, or <i>assert</i> his right to what he is willing to contend
for; or he may <i>assert</i> in discussion what he is ready to maintain
by argument or evidence. To <i>assert</i> without proof is always to
lay oneself open to the suspicion of having no proof to offer, and
seems to arrogate too much to one's personal authority, and hence
in such cases both the verb <i>assert</i> and its noun <i>assertion</i> have an
unfavorable sense; we say a mere <i>assertion</i>, a bare <i>assertion</i>, his
unsupported <i>assertion</i>; he <i>asserted</i> his innocence has less force
than he <i>affirmed</i> or <i>maintained</i> his innocence. <i>Affirm</i>, <i>state</i>, and
<i>tell</i> have not the controversial sense of <i>assert</i>, but are simply
declarative. To <i>vindicate</i> is to defend successfully what is
assailed. Almost every criminal will <i>assert</i> his innocence; the
honest man will seldom lack means to <i>vindicate</i> his integrity.</p>

<p>A <i>story</i> is the telling of some series of connected incidents or

termed a <i>story</i>. In children's talk, a <i>story</i> is a common euphemism
for a falsehood. <i>Tale</i> is nearly synonymous with <i>story</i>, but
is somewhat archaic; it is used for an imaginative, legendary, or
fictitious <i>recital</i>, especially if of ancient date; as, a fairy <i>tale</i>;
also, for an idle or malicious report; as, do not tell <i>tales</i>; "where
there is no <i>tale</i>-bearer, the strife ceaseth." <i>Prov.</i> xxvi, 20. An <i>anecdote</i>
tells briefly some <i>incident</i>, assumed to be fact. If it passes
close limits of brevity, it ceases to be an <i>anecdote</i>, and becomes a

<p><i>Stupor</i> is a condition of the body in which the action of the
senses and faculties is suspended or greatly dulled&mdash;weakness or
loss of sensibility. The <i>apathy</i> of disease is a mental affection, a
state of morbid indifference; <i>lethargy</i> is a morbid tendency to
heavy and continued sleep, from which the patient may perhaps
be momentarily aroused. <i>Coma</i> is a deep, abnormal sleep, from
which the patient can not be aroused, or is aroused only with difficulty,
a state of profound <i>insensibility</i>, perhaps with full pulse and
deep, stertorous breathing, and is due to brain-oppression. <i>Syncope</i>
or <i>swooning</i> is a sudden loss of sensation and of power of
motion, with suspension of pulse and of respiration, and is due to
failure of heart-action, as from sudden nervous shock or intense
mental emotion. <i>Insensibility</i> is a general term denoting loss of
feeling from any cause, as from cold, intoxication, or injury.
<i>Stupor</i> is especially profound and confirmed <i>insensibility</i>, properly
comatose. <i>Asphyxia</i> is a special form of <i>syncope</i> resulting

<p><i>Subjective</i> and <i>objective</i> are synonyms in but one point of view,
being, for the most part, strictly antonyms. <i>Subjective</i> signifies
relating to the subject of mental states, that is, to the person who
experiences them; <i>objective</i> signifies relating to the object of mental
states, that is, to something outside the perceiving mind; in
brief phrase it may be said that <i>subjective</i> relates to something
within the mind, <i>objective</i> to something without. A mountain, as a
mass of a certain size, contour, color, etc., is an <i>objective</i> fact; the
impression our mind receives, the mental picture it forms of the
mountain, is <i>subjective</i>. But this <i>subjective</i> impression may become
itself the object of thought (called "subject-object"), as
when we compare our mental picture of the mountain with our
idea of a plain or river. The direct experiences of the soul, as joy,
grief, hope, fear, are purely <i>subjective</i>; the outward causes of
these experiences, as prosperity, bereavement, disappointment,
are <i>objective</i>. That which has independent existence or authority
apart from our experience or thought is said to have <i>objective</i> existence
or authority; thus we speak of the <i>objective</i> authority of
the moral law. Different individuals may receive different <i>subjective</i>
impressions from the same <i>objective</i> fact, that which to one
is a cause of hope being to another a cause of fear, etc. The style
of a writer is called <i>objective</i> when it derives its materials mainly
from or reaches out toward external objects; it is called <i>subjective</i>
when it derives its materials mainly from or constantly tends
to revert to the personal experience of the author. Compare

<p>A <i>subsidy</i> is pecuniary aid directly granted by government to
an individual or commercial enterprise, or money furnished by
one nation to another to aid it in carrying on war against a common
enemy. A nation grants a <i>subsidy</i> to an ally, pays a <i>tribute</i> to a
conqueror. An <i>indemnity</i> is in the nature of things limited and
temporary, while a <i>tribute</i> might be exacted indefinitely. A<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
nation may also grant a <i>subsidy</i> to its own citizens as a means of
promoting the public welfare; as, a <i>subsidy</i> to a steamship company.
The somewhat rare term <i>subvention</i> is especially applied
to a <i>grant</i> of governmental aid to a literary or artistic enterprise.
Governmental <i>aid</i> to a commercial or industrial enterprise other
than a transportation company is more frequently called a <i>bounty</i>
than a <i>subsidy</i>; as, the sugar <i>bounty</i>. The word <i>bounty</i> may be
applied to almost any regular or stipulated <i>allowance</i> by a government
to a citizen or citizens; as, a <i>bounty</i> for enlisting in the
army; a <i>bounty</i> for killing wolves. A <i>bounty</i> is offered for something

<p>A <i>suggestion</i> (L. <i>sub</i>, under, and <i>gero</i>, bring) brings something
before the mind less directly than by formal or explicit statement,
as by a partial statement, an incidental allusion, an illustration, a
question, or the like. <i>Suggestion</i> is often used of an unobtrusive
statement of one's views or wishes to another, leaving consideration
and any consequent action entirely to his judgment, and is hence,
in many cases, the most respectful way in which one can convey
his views to a superior or a stranger. A <i>suggestion</i> may be given
unintentionally, and even unconsciously, as when we say an author
has "a <i>suggestive</i> style." An <i>intimation</i> is a <i>suggestion</i> in brief
utterance, or sometimes by significant act, gesture, or token, of
one's meaning or wishes; in the latter case it is often the act of a
superior; as, God in his providence gives us <i>intimations</i> of his will.
A <i>hint</i> is still more limited in expression, and is always covert, but
frequently with good intent; as, to give one a <i>hint</i> of danger or
of opportunity. <i>Insinuation</i> and <i>innuendo</i> are used in the bad
sense; an <i>insinuation</i> is a covert or partly veiled injurious utterance,
sometimes to the very person attacked; an <i>innuendo</i> is commonly
secret as well as sly, as if pointing one out by a significant
nod (L. <i>in</i>, in, to, and <i>nuo</i>, nod).</p>

<p>The <i>supernatural</i> (<i>super</i>, above) is above or superior to the
recognized powers of nature; the <i>preternatural</i> (<i>preter</i>, beyond)
is aside from or beyond the recognized results or operations of
natural law, often in the sense of inauspicious; as, a <i>preternatural</i>
gloom. <i>Miraculous</i> is more emphatic and specific than <i>supernatural</i>,
as referring to the direct personal intervention of divine
power. Some hold that a miracle, as the raising of the dead, is a
direct suspension and even violation of natural laws by the fiat of
the Creator, and hence is, in the strictest sense, <i>supernatural</i>;
others hold that the miracle is simply the calling forth of a power
residing in the laws of nature, but not within their ordinary operation,
and dependent on a distinct act of God, so that the <i>miraculous</i>
might be termed "extranatural," rather than <i>supernatural</i>.
All that is beyond human power is <i>superhuman</i>; as, prophecy<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>

<p><i>Support</i> and <i>sustain</i> alike signify to <i>hold up</i> or <i>keep up</i>, to
prevent from falling or sinking; but <i>sustain</i> has a special sense of
continuous exertion or of great strength continuously exerted, as
when we speak of <i>sustained</i> endeavor or a <i>sustained</i> note; a
flower is <i>supported</i> by the stem or a temple-roof by arches; the
foundations of a great building <i>sustain</i> an enormous pressure; to
<i>sustain</i> life implies a greater exigency and need than to <i>support</i>
life; to say one is <i>sustained</i> under affliction is to say more both
of the severity of the trial and the completeness of the <i>upholding</i>
than if we say he is <i>supported</i>. To <i>bear</i> is the most general word,
denoting all <i>holding up</i> or <i>keeping up</i> of any object, whether in
rest or motion; in the derived senses it refers to something that
is a tax upon strength or endurance; as, to <i>bear</i> a strain; to <i>bear</i>
pain or grief. To <i>maintain</i> is to <i>keep</i> in a state or condition,
especially in an excellent and desirable condition; as, to <i>maintain</i>
health or reputation; to <i>maintain</i> one's position; to <i>maintain</i> a
cause or proposition is to hold it against opposition or difficulty.
To <i>support</i> may be partial, to <i>maintain</i> is complete; <i>maintain</i> is
a word of more dignity than <i>support</i>; a man <i>supports</i> his family;
a state <i>maintains</i> an army or navy. To <i>prop</i> is always partial,
signifying to add <i>support</i> to something that is insecure. Compare

<p>To <i>suppose</i> is temporarily to assume a thing as true, either<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
with the expectation of finding it so or for the purpose of ascertaining
what would follow if it were so. To <i>suppose</i> is also to
think a thing to be true while aware or conceding that the belief
does not rest upon any sure ground, and may not accord with
fact; or yet again, to <i>suppose</i> is to imply as true or involved as a
necessary inference; as, design <i>supposes</i> the existence of a designer.
To <i>conjecture</i> is to put together the nearest available
materials for a provisional opinion, always with some expectation
of finding the facts to be as <i>conjectured</i>. To <i>imagine</i> is to form a
mental image of something as existing, tho its actual existence
may be unknown, or even impossible. To <i>think</i>, in this application,
is to hold as the result of thought what is admitted not to be
matter of exact or certain knowledge; as, I do not know, but I

<p>To <i>surrender</i> is to <i>give up</i> upon compulsion, as to an enemy in
war, hence to <i>give up</i> to any person, passion, influence, or power.
To <i>yield</i> is to give place or give way under pressure, and hence
under compulsion. <i>Yield</i> implies more softness or concession than
<i>surrender</i>; the most determined men may <i>surrender</i> to overwhelming
force; when one <i>yields</i>, his spirit is at least somewhat subdued.
A monarch or a state <i>cedes</i> territory perhaps for a consideration;
<i>surrenders</i> an army, a navy, or a fortified place to a
conqueror; a military commander <i>abandons</i> an untenable position
or unavailable stores. We <i>sacrifice</i> something precious through

<p><i>Synonymous</i> (Gr. <i>syn</i>, together, and <i>onyma</i>, name) strictly signifies
being <i>interchangeable</i> names for the same thing, or being one<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
of two or more <i>interchangeable</i> names for the same thing; to say
that two words are <i>synonymous</i> is strictly to say they are <i>alike</i>,
<i>equivalent</i>, <i>identical</i>, or the <i>same</i> in meaning; but the use of <i>synonymous</i>
in this strict sense is somewhat rare, and rather with
reference to statements than to words.</p>

<div class="bq1"><p>To say that we are morally developed is <i>synonymous</i> with saying that we have
reaped what some one has suffered for us.</p>

<p class="tdr"><span class="smc">H. W. Beecher</span> <i>Royal Truths</i> p. 294. [<span class="smcl">T. &amp; F.</span> '66.]</p></div>

<p>In the strictest sense, <i>synonymous</i> words scarcely exist; rarely,
if ever, are any two words in any language <i>equivalent</i> or <i>identical</i> in
meaning; where a difference in meaning can not easily be shown,
a difference in usage commonly exists, so that the words are not
<i>interchangeable</i>. By <i>synonymous</i> words (or <i>synonyms</i>) we usually
understand words that coincide or nearly coincide in some part of
their meaning, and may hence within certain limits be used interchangeably,
while outside of those limits they may differ very
greatly in meaning and use. It is the office of a work on synonyms
to point out these correspondences and differences, that
language may have the flexibility that comes from freedom of
selection within the common limits, with the perspicuity and precision
that result from exact choice of the fittest words to express
each shade of meaning outside of the common limits. To consider
<i>synonymous</i> words <i>identical</i> is fatal to accuracy; to forget that
they are <i>similar</i>, to some extent <i>equivalent</i>, and sometimes <i>interchangeable</i>,
is destructive of freedom and variety.</p>

<h4>Synonyms:</h4>

<table class="tbs" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">
<tr><td>manner,</td><td>method,</td><td>mode,</td><td>order,</td><td>regularity,</td><td>rule.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Order</i> in this connection denotes the fact or result of proper
arrangement according to the due relation or sequence of the
matters arranged; as, these papers are in <i>order</i>; in alphabetical
<i>order</i>. <i>Method</i> denotes a process, a general or established way of
doing or proceeding in anything; <i>rule</i>, an authoritative requirement
or an established course of things; <i>system</i>, not merely a law
of action or procedure, but a comprehensive plan in which all the
parts are related to each other and to the whole; as, a <i>system</i> of
theology; a railroad <i>system</i>; the digestive <i>system</i>; <i>manner</i> refers
to the external qualities of actions, and to those often as settled
and characteristic; we speak of a <i>system</i> of taxation, a <i>method</i> of
collecting taxes, the <i>rules</i> by which assessments are made; or we<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
say, as a <i>rule</i> the payments are heaviest at a certain time of year; a
just tax may be made odious by the <i>manner</i> of its collection.
<i>Regularity</i> applies to the even disposition of objects or uniform
recurrence of acts in a series. There may be <i>regularity</i> without
<i>order</i>, as in the recurrence of paroxysms of disease or insanity;
there may be <i>order</i> without <i>regularity</i>, as in the arrangement of
furniture in a room, where the objects are placed at varying distances.
<i>Order</i> commonly implies the design of an intelligent
agent or the appearance or suggestion of such design; <i>regularity</i>
applies to an actual uniform disposition or recurrence with no
suggestion of purpose, and as applied to human affairs is less
intelligent and more mechanical than <i>order</i>. The most perfect
<i>order</i> is often secured with least <i>regularity</i>, as in a fine essay or
oration. The same may be said of <i>system</i>. There is a <i>regularity</i>
of dividing a treatise into topics, paragraphs, and sentences,
that is destructive of true rhetorical <i>system</i>. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#HABIT">HABIT</a></span>;

<p><i>Dumb</i>, <i>mute</i>, <i>silent</i> and <i>speechless</i> refer to fact or state; <i>taciturn</i>
refers to habit and disposition. The talkative person may be
stricken <i>dumb</i> with surprise or terror; the obstinate may remain
<i>mute</i>; one may be <i>silent</i> through preoccupation of mind or of set purpose;
but the <i>taciturn</i> person is averse to the utterance of thought
or feeling and to communication with others, either from natural
disposition or for the occasion. One who is <i>silent</i> does not speak
at all; one who is <i>taciturn</i> speaks when compelled, but in a grudging
way that repels further approach. <i>Reserved</i> suggests more
of method and intention than <i>taciturn</i>, applying often to some
special time or topic; one who is communicative regarding all
else may be <i>reserved</i> about his business. <i>Reserved</i> is thus closely
equivalent to <i>uncommunicative</i>, but is a somewhat stronger word,
often suggesting pride or haughtiness, as when we say one is <i>reserved</i>

<tr><td>dainty,</td><td>elegant,</td><td colspan="3">exquisite,</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Elegant</i> (L. <i>elegans</i>, select) refers to that assemblage of
qualities which makes anything choice to persons of culture and
refinement; it refers to the lighter, finer elements of beauty in
form or motion, especially denoting that which exhibits faultless
taste and perfection of finish. That which is <i>elegant</i> is made so
not merely by nature, but by art and culture; a woodland dell
may be beautiful or picturesque, but would not ordinarily be
termed <i>elegant</i>. <i>Tasteful</i> refers to that in which the element of
taste is more prominent, standing, as it were, more by itself, while
in <i>elegant</i> it is blended as part of the whole. <i>Tasty</i> is an inferior
word, used colloquially in a similar sense. <i>Chaste</i> (primarily
<i>pure</i>), denotes in literature and art that which is true to the higher
and finer feelings and free from all excess or meretricious ornament.
<i>Dainty</i> and <i>delicate</i> refer to the lighter and finer elements
of taste and beauty, <i>dainty</i> tending in personal use to an excessive
scrupulousness which is more fully expressed by <i>fastidious</i>. <i>Nice</i>
and <i>delicate</i> both refer to exact adaptation to some standard; the
bar of a balance can be said to be nicely or delicately poised; as
regards matters of taste and beauty, <i>delicate</i> is a higher and more
discriminating word than <i>nice</i>, and is always used in a favorable
sense; a <i>delicate</i> distinction is one worth observing; a <i>nice</i> distinction
may be so, or may be overstrained and unduly subtle; <i>fine</i>
in such use, is closely similar to <i>delicate</i> and <i>nice</i>, but (tho capable
of an unfavorable sense) has commonly a suggestion of positive
excellence or admirableness; a <i>fine</i> touch does something; <i>fine</i>
perceptions are to some purpose; <i>delicate</i> is capable of the single
unfavorable sense of frail or fragile; as, a <i>delicate</i> constitution.
<i>Esthetic</i> or <i>esthetical</i> refers to beauty or the appreciation of the
beautiful, especially from the philosophic point of view. <i>Exquisite</i>
denotes the utmost perfection of the <i>elegant</i> in minute details;
we speak of an <i>elegant</i> garment, an <i>exquisite</i> lace. <i>Exquisite</i> is
also applied to intense keenness of any feeling; as, <i>exquisite</i>
delight; <i>exquisite</i> pain. See <span class="smcl"><a href="#BEAUTIFUL">BEAUTIFUL</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#DELICIOUS">DELICIOUS</a></span>; <span class="smcl"><a href="#FINE">FINE</a></span>.</p>

</table>

<p>To <i>teach</i> is simply to communicate knowledge; to <i>instruct</i>
(originally, to build in or into, put in order) is to impart knowledge
with special method and completeness; <i>instruct</i> has also an
authoritative sense nearly equivalent to command. To <i>educate</i>
is to draw out or develop harmoniously the mental powers, and,
in the fullest sense, the moral powers as well. To <i>train</i> is to
direct to a certain result powers already existing. <i>Train</i> is used
in preference to <i>educate</i> when the reference is to the inferior animals
or to the physical powers of man; as, to <i>train</i> a horse; to
<i>train</i> the hand or eye. To <i>discipline</i> is to bring into habitual and
complete subjection to authority; <i>discipline</i> is a severe word, and
is often used as a euphemism for <i>punish</i>; to be thoroughly effective
in war, soldiers must be <i>disciplined</i> as well as <i>trained</i>. To
<i>nurture</i> is to furnish the care and sustenance necessary for physical,
mental, and moral growth; <i>nurture</i> is a more tender and
homelike word than <i>educate</i>. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#EDUCATION">EDUCATION</a></span>.</p>

</table>

<p><i>Rashness</i> applies to the actual rushing into danger without
counting the cost; <i>temerity</i> denotes the needless exposure of
oneself to peril which is or might be clearly seen to be such.
<i>Rashness</i> is used chiefly of bodily acts, <i>temerity</i> often of mental
or social matters; there may be a noble <i>rashness</i>, but <i>temerity</i> is
always used in a bad sense. We say it is amazing that one should
have had the <i>temerity</i> to make a statement which could be readily
proved a falsehood, or to make an unworthy proposal to one sure
to resent it; in such use <i>temerity</i> is often closely allied to <i>hardihood</i>,
<i>audacity</i>, or <i>presumption</i>. <i>Venturesomeness</i> dallies on the
edge of danger and experiments with it; <i>foolhardiness</i> rushes in
for want of sense, <i>heedlessness</i> for want of attention, <i>rashness</i> for
want of reflection, <i>recklessness</i> from disregard of consequences.
<i>Audacity</i>, in the sense here considered, denotes a dashing and
somewhat reckless courage, in defiance of conventionalities, or of<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
other men's opinions, or of what would be deemed probable consequences;

<tr><td>condition,</td><td>expression,</td><td>name,</td><td>word.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Term</i> in its figurative uses always retains something of its literal
sense of a boundary or limit. The <i>articles</i> of a contract or other
instrument are simply the portions into which it is divided for
convenience; the <i>terms</i> are the essential statements on which its
validity depends&mdash;as it were, the landmarks of its meaning or
power; a <i>condition</i> is a contingent <i>term</i> which may become fixed
upon the happening of some contemplated event. In logic a <i>term</i>
is one of the essential members of a proposition, the boundary of
statement in some one direction. Thus, in general use <i>term</i> is more
restricted than <i>word</i>, <i>expression</i>, or <i>phrase</i>; a <i>term</i> is a <i>word</i> that
limits meaning to a fixed point of statement or to a special class of
subjects, as when we speak of the definition of <i>terms</i>, that is of
the key-<i>words</i> in any discussion; or we say, that is a legal or scientific

</table>

<p>Anything <i>short</i> or <i>brief</i> is of relatively small extent. That
which is <i>concise</i> (L. <i>con-</i>, with, together, and <i>c&aelig;do</i>, cut) is trimmed
down, and that which is <i>condensed</i> (L. <i>con-</i>, with, together, and
<i>densus</i>, thick) is, as it were, pressed together, so as to include as
much as possible within a small space. That which is <i>compendious</i>
(L. <i>com-</i>, together, and <i>pendo</i>, weigh) gathers the substance of
a matter into a few words, weighty and effective. The <i>succinct</i>
(L. <i>succinctus</i>, from <i>sub-</i>, under, and <i>cingo</i>, gird; girded from
below) has an alert effectiveness as if girded for action. The <i>summary</i>
is compacted to the utmost, often to the point of abruptness;
as, we speak of a <i>summary</i> statement or a <i>summary</i> dismissal.
That which is <i>terse</i> (L. <i>tersus</i>, from <i>tergo</i>, rub off) has an elegant
and finished completeness within the smallest possible compass, as<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
if rubbed or polished down to the utmost. A <i>sententious</i> style is
one abounding in sentences that are singly striking or memorable,
apart from the context; the word may be used invidiously of that
which is pretentiously oracular. A <i>pithy</i> utterance gives the gist
of a matter effectively, whether in rude or elegant style.</p>

<p><i>Testimony</i>, in legal as well as in common use, signifies the
statements of witnesses. <i>Deposition</i> and <i>affidavit</i> denote <i>testimony</i>
reduced to writing; the <i>deposition</i> differs from the <i>affidavit</i>
in that the latter is voluntary and without cross-examination,
while the former is made under interrogatories and subject to
cross-examination. <i>Evidence</i> is a broader term, including the <i>testimony</i>
of witnesses and all facts of every kind that tend to prove
a thing true; we have the <i>testimony</i> of a traveler that a fugitive
passed this way; his footprints in the sand are additional <i>evidence</i>

<p><i>Therefore</i>, signifying for that (or this) reason, is the most precise
and formal word for expressing the direct conclusion of a
chain of reasoning; <i>then</i> carries a similar but slighter sense of
inference, which it gives incidentally rather than formally; as,
"All men are mortal; C&aelig;sar is a man; <i>therefore</i> C&aelig;sar is mortal;"
or, "The contract is awarded; <i>then</i> there is no more to be
said." <i>Consequently</i> denotes a direct result, but more frequently
of a practical than a theoretic kind; as, "Important matters
demand my attention; <i>consequently</i> I shall not sail to-day." <i>Consequently</i>
is rarely used in the formal conclusions of logic or
mathematics, but marks rather the freer and looser style of rhetorical
argument. <i>Accordingly</i> denotes correspondence, which
may or may not be consequence; it is often used in narration; as,
"The soldiers were eager and confident; <i>accordingly</i> they sprang
forward at the word of command." <i>Thence</i> is a word of more<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
sweeping inference than <i>therefore</i>, applying not merely to a
single set of premises, but often to all that has gone before, including
the reasonable inferences that have not been formally stated.
<i>Wherefore</i> is the correlative of <i>therefore</i>, and <i>whence</i> of <i>hence</i> or

<p>A <i>crowd</i> is a company of persons filling to excess the space

total number in a <i>crowd</i> may be great or small. <i>Throng</i> is a word
of vastness and dignity, always implying that the persons are
numerous as well as pressed or pressing closely together; there
may be a dense <i>crowd</i> in a small room, but there can not be a
<i>throng</i>. <i>Host</i> and <i>multitude</i> both imply vast numbers, but a <i>multitude</i>
may be diffused over a great space so as to be nowhere a
<i>crowd</i>; <i>host</i> is a military term, and properly denotes an assembly
too orderly for crowding. <i>Concourse</i> signifies a spontaneous gathering
of many persons moved by a common impulse, and has a
suggestion of stateliness not found in the word <i>crowd</i>, while suggesting
less massing and pressure than is indicated by the word

<p><i>Sequence</i> and <i>succession</i> apply to events viewed as following
one another; <i>time</i> and <i>duration</i> denote something conceived of as
enduring while events take place and acts are done. According
to the necessary conditions of human thought, events are contained
in <i>time</i> as objects are in space, <i>time</i> existing before the event, measuring
it as it passes, and still existing when the event is past.
<i>Duration</i> and <i>succession</i> are more general words than <i>time</i>; we
can speak of infinite or eternal <i>duration</i> or <i>succession</i>, but <i>time</i>

</table>

<p>To <i>tilt</i> or <i>tip</i> is to throw out of a horizontal position by raising
one side or end or lowering the other; the words are closely similar,
but <i>tilt</i> suggests more of fluctuation or instability. <i>Slant</i> and
<i>slope</i> are said of things somewhat fixed or permanent in a position
out of the horizontal or perpendicular; the roof <i>slants</i>, the hill
<i>slopes</i>. <i>Incline</i> is a more formal word for <i>tip</i>, and also for <i>slant</i>
or <i>slope</i>. To <i>cant</i> is to set slantingly; in many cases <i>tip</i> and <i>cant</i>
might be interchanged, but <i>tip</i> is more temporary, often momentary;
one <i>tips</i> a pail so that the water flows over the edge; a
mechanic <i>cants</i> a table by making or setting one side higher than
the other. A vessel <i>careens</i> in the wind; <i>lists</i>, usually, from
shifting of cargo, from water in the hold, etc. <i>Careening</i> is
always toward one side or the other; <i>listing</i> may be forward or

<tr><td colspan="6">fag,</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To <i>tire</i> is to reduce strength in any degree by exertion; one
may be <i>tired</i> just enough to make rest pleasant, or even unconsciously
<i>tired</i>, becoming aware of the fact only when he ceases
the exertion; or, on the other hand, he may be, according to the
common phrase, "too <i>tired</i> to stir;" but for this extreme condition
the stronger words are commonly used. One who is <i>fatigued</i>
suffers from a conscious and painful lack of strength as the result
of some overtaxing; an invalid may be <i>fatigued</i> with very slight
exertion; when one is <i>wearied</i>, the painful lack of strength is the
result of long-continued demand or strain; one is <i>exhausted</i> when
the strain has been so severe and continuous as utterly to consume
the strength, so that further exertion is for the time impossible.
One is <i>fagged</i> by drudgery; he is <i>jaded</i> by incessant repetition
of the same act until it becomes increasingly difficult or
well-nigh impossible; as, a horse is <i>jaded</i> by a long and unbroken
journey.</p>

<tr><td>apparatus,</td><td>implement,</td><td>machine,</td><td>utensil,</td></tr>
<tr><td>appliance,</td><td>instrument,</td><td>mechanism,</td><td>weapon.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A <i>tool</i> is something that is both contrived and used for extending
the force of an intelligent agent to something that is to be
operated upon. Those things by which pacific and industrial
operations are performed are alone properly called <i>tools</i>, those
designed for warlike purposes being designated <i>weapons</i>. An
<i>instrument</i> is anything through which power is applied and a
result produced; in general usage, the word is of considerably
wider meaning than <i>tool</i>; as, a piano is a musical <i>instrument</i>.
<i>Instrument</i> is the word usually applied to <i>tools</i> used in scientific
pursuits; as, we speak of a surgeon's or an optician's <i>instruments</i>.
An <i>implement</i> is a mechanical agency considered with reference
to some specific purpose to which it is adapted; as, an agricultural
<i>implement</i>; <i>implements</i> of war. <i>Implement</i> is a less technical and
artificial term than <i>tool</i>. The paw of a tiger might be termed a
terrible <i>implement</i>, but not a <i>tool</i>. A <i>utensil</i> is that which may
be used for some special purpose; the word is especially applied
to articles used for domestic or agricultural purposes; as, kitchen
<i>utensils</i>; farming <i>utensils</i>. An <i>appliance</i> is that which is or may
be applied to the accomplishment of a result, either independently
or as subordinate to something more extensive or important; every
mechanical <i>tool</i> is an <i>appliance</i>, but not every <i>appliance</i> is a <i>tool</i>;
the traces of a harness are <i>appliances</i> for traction, but they are
not <i>tools</i>. <i>Mechanism</i> is a word of wide meaning, denoting any
combination of mechanical devices for united action. A <i>machine</i>
in the most general sense is any mechanical <i>instrument</i> for the
conversion of motion; in this sense a lever is a <i>machine</i>; but in
more commonly accepted usage a <i>machine</i> is distinguished from a
<i>tool</i> by its complexity, and by the combination and coordination
of powers and movements for the production of a result. A chisel
by itself is a <i>tool</i>; when it is set so as to be operated by a crank
and pitman, the entire <i>mechanism</i> is called a <i>machine</i>; as, a mortising-<i>machine</i>.
An <i>apparatus</i> may be a <i>machine</i>, but the word
is commonly used for a collection of distinct articles to be used in
connection or combination for a certain purpose&mdash;a mechanical
equipment; as, the <i>apparatus</i> of a gymnasium; especially, for a
collection of <i>appliances</i> for some scientific purpose; as, a chemical
or surgical <i>apparatus</i>; an <i>apparatus</i> may include many <i>tools</i>,
<i>instruments</i>, or <i>implements</i>. <i>Implement</i> is for the most part and<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
<i>utensil</i> is altogether restricted to the literal sense; <i>instrument</i>,
<i>machine</i>, and <i>tool</i> have figurative use, <i>instrument</i> being used
largely in a good, <i>tool</i> always in a bad sense; <i>machine</i> inclines to
the unfavorable sense, as implying that human agents are made
mechanically subservient to some controlling will; as, an <i>instrument</i>
of Providence; the <i>tool</i> of a tyrant; a political <i>machine</i>.</p>

</table>

<p>A <i>topic</i> (Gr. <i>topos</i>, place) is a <i>head</i> of discourse. Since a <i>topic</i>
for discussion is often stated in the form of a <i>question</i>, <i>question</i>
has come to be extensively used to denote a debatable <i>topic</i>, especially
of a practical nature&mdash;an <i>issue</i>; as, the labor <i>question</i>; the
temperance <i>question</i>. In deliberative assemblies a <i>proposition</i>
presented or moved for acceptance is called a <i>motion</i>, and such a
<i>motion</i> or other matter for consideration is known as the <i>question</i>,
since it is or may be stated in interrogative form to be answered
by each member with a vote of "aye" or "no;" a member is
required to speak to the <i>question</i>; the chairman puts the <i>question</i>.
In speaking or writing the general <i>subject</i> or <i>theme</i> may be termed
the <i>topic</i>, tho it is more usual to apply the latter term to the
subordinate <i>divisions</i>, <i>points</i>, or <i>heads</i> of discourse; as, to
enlarge on this <i>topic</i> would carry me too far from my <i>subject</i>; a
pleasant drive will suggest many <i>topics</i> for conversation.</p>

</table>

<p>A <i>memorial</i> is that which is intended or fitted to bring to
remembrance something that has passed away; it may be vast
and stately. On the other hand, a slight <i>token</i> of regard may be
a cherished <i>memorial</i> of a friend; either a concrete object or an
observance may be a <i>memorial</i>. A <i>vestige</i> is always slight compared
with that whose existence it recalls; as, scattered mounds
containing implements, weapons, etc., are <i>vestiges</i> of a former civilization.
A <i>vestige</i> is always a part of that which has passed away;
a <i>trace</i> may be merely the <i>mark</i> made by something that has
been present or passed by, and that is still existing, or some slight<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>

</table>

<p>There are many acts that one may <i>do</i>, <i>accomplish</i>, or <i>perform</i>
unaided; what he <i>transacts</i> is by means of or in association with
others; one may <i>do</i> a duty, <i>perform</i> a vow, <i>accomplish</i> a task, but
he <i>transacts</i> business, since that always involves the agency of
others. To <i>negotiate</i> and to <i>treat</i> are likewise collective acts, but
both these words lay stress upon deliberation with adjustment of
mutual claims and interests; <i>transact</i>, while it may depend upon
previous deliberation, states execution only. Notes, bills of exchange,
loans, and treaties are said to be <i>negotiated</i>, the word so
used covering not merely the preliminary consideration, but the
final settlement. <i>Negotiate</i> has more reference to execution than
<i>treat</i>; nations may <i>treat</i> of peace without result, but when a
treaty is <i>negotiated</i>, peace is secured; the citizens of the two
nations are then free to <i>transact</i> business with one another.

<p>One's <i>acts</i> or <i>deeds</i> may be exclusively his own; his <i>transactions</i>
involve the agency or participation of others. A <i>transaction</i>
is something completed; a <i>proceeding</i> is or is viewed as something
in progress; but since <i>transaction</i> is often used to include
the steps leading to the conclusion, while <i>proceedings</i> may result
in <i>action</i>, the dividing line between the two words becomes sometimes
quite faint, tho <i>transaction</i> often emphasizes the fact of
something done, or brought to a conclusion. Both <i>transactions</i>
and <i>proceedings</i> are used of the records of a deliberative body,
especially when published; strictly used, the two are distinguished;
as, the Philosophical <i>Transactions</i> of the Royal Society
of London give in full the papers read; the <i>Proceedings</i> of the
American Philological Association give in full the <i>business</i> done,

<h3>TRANSCENDENTAL.</h3>

<h4>Synonyms:</h4>

<table class="tbs" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" summary="">

<p><i>Intuitive</i> truths are those which are in the mind independently
of all experience, not being derived from experience nor limited
by it, as that the whole is greater than a part, or that things which
are equal to the same thing are equal to one another. All <i>intuitive</i>
truths or beliefs are <i>transcendental</i>. But <i>transcendental</i> is a
wider term than <i>intuitive</i>, including all within the limits of
thought that is not derived from experience, as the ideas of space
and time. "Being is <i>transcendental</i>.... As being can not be
included under any genus, but transcends them all, so the properties
or affections of being have also been called <i>transcendental</i>."
K.-F. <i>Vocab. Philos.</i> p. 530. "<i>Transcendent</i> he [Kant] employed
to denote what is wholly beyond experience, being neither given
as an a posteriori nor <i>a priori</i> element of cognition&mdash;what therefore
transcends every category of thought." K.-F. <i>Vocab. Philos.</i>
p. 531. <i>Transcendental</i> has been applied in the language of the
Emersonian school to the soul's supposed <i>intuitive</i> knowledge of
things divine and human, so far as they are capable of being known
to man. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#MYSTERIOUS">MYSTERIOUS</a></span>.</p>

<tr><td>ephemeral,</td><td>flitting,</td><td>momentary,</td><td>temporary,</td></tr>
<tr><td>evanescent,</td><td>flying,</td><td>passing,</td><td>transitory.</td></tr>
</table>

<p><i>Transient</i> and <i>transitory</i> are both derived from the same original
source (L. <i>trans</i>, over, and <i>eo</i>, go), denoting that which quickly
passes or is passing away, but there is between them a fine shade
of difference. A thing is <i>transient</i> which in fact is not lasting; a
thing is <i>transitory</i> which by its very nature must soon pass away;
a thing is <i>temporary</i> (L. <i>tempus</i>, time) which is intended to last or
be made use of but a little while; as, a <i>transient</i> joy; this <i>transitory</i>
life; a <i>temporary</i> chairman. <i>Ephemeral</i> (Gr. <i>epi</i>, on, and
<i>hemera</i>, day) literally lasting but for a day, often marks more
strongly than <i>transient</i> exceeding brevity of duration; it agrees
with <i>transitory</i> in denoting that its object is destined to pass away,
but is stronger, as denoting not only its certain but its speedy
extinction; thus that which is <i>ephemeral</i> is looked upon as at once
slight and perishable, and the word carries often a suggestion of
contempt; man's life is <i>transitory</i>, a butterfly's existence is
<i>ephemeral</i>; with no solid qualities or worthy achievements a pretender<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
may sometimes gain an <i>ephemeral</i> popularity. That which
is <i>fleeting</i> is viewed as in the act of passing swiftly by, and that
which is <i>fugitive</i> (L. <i>fugio</i>, flee) as eluding attempts to detain it;
that which is <i>evanescent</i> (L. <i>evanesco</i>, from <i>e</i>, out, and <i>vanus</i>,
empty, vain) as in the act of vanishing even while we gaze, as the
hues of the sunset.</p>

<p><i>Unity</i> is <i>oneness</i>, the state of being one, especially of that
which never has been divided or of that which can not be conceived
of as resolved into parts; as, the <i>unity</i> of God or the <i>unity</i>
of the human soul. <i>Union</i> is a bringing together of things that
have been distinct, so that they combine or coalesce to form a new
whole, or the state or condition of things thus brought together;
in a <i>union</i> the separate individuality of the things united is never
lost sight of; we speak of the <i>union</i> of the parts of a fractured
bone or of the <i>union</i> of hearts in marriage. But <i>unity</i> can be
said of that which is manifestly or even conspicuously made up
of parts, when a single purpose or ideal is so subserved by all
that their possible separateness is lost sight of; as, we speak of
the <i>unity</i> of the human body, or of the <i>unity</i> of the church.

<p><i>Utility</i> (L. <i>utilis</i>, useful) signifies primarily the quality of being
useful, but is somewhat more abstract and philosophical than <i>usefulness</i>
or <i>use</i>, and is often employed to denote adaptation to produce
a valuable result, while <i>usefulness</i> denotes the actual production
of such result. We contrast beauty and <i>utility</i>. We say
of an invention, its <i>utility</i> is questionable, or, on the other hand,
its <i>usefulness</i> has been proved by ample trial, or I have found it
of <i>use</i>; still, <i>utility</i> and <i>usefulness</i> are frequently interchanged.
<i>Expediency</i> (L. <i>ex</i>, out, and <i>pes</i>, foot; literally, the getting the foot
out) refers primarily to escape from or avoidance of some difficulty
or trouble; either <i>expediency</i> or <i>utility</i> may be used to signify
<i>profit</i> or <i>advantage</i> considered apart from right as the
ground of moral obligation, or of actions that have a moral character,
<i>expediency</i> denoting immediate <i>advantage</i> on a contracted
view, and especially with reference to avoiding danger, difficulty,
or loss, while <i>utility</i> may be so broadened as to cover all existence
through all time, as in the utilitarian theory of morals.

A <i>vacant</i> room may not be <i>empty</i>, and an <i>empty</i> house

to things of some dignity; <i>empty</i>, from the Saxon, is preferred
in speaking of slight, common, or homely matters, tho
it may be applied with special force to the highest; we speak of
<i>empty</i> space, a <i>vacant</i> lot, an <i>empty</i> dish, an <i>empty</i> sleeve, a <i>vacant</i>
mind, an <i>empty</i> heart, an <i>empty</i> boast, a <i>vacant</i> office, a <i>vacant</i> or

but for the most part confined to abstract relations, <i>devoid</i> being
followed by <i>of</i>, and having with that addition the effect of a
prepositional phrase; as, the article is <i>devoid of</i> sense; the contract
is <i>void</i> for want of consideration. <i>Waste</i>, in this connection,
applies to that which is made so by devastation or ruin, or
gives an impression of desolation, especially as combined with
vastness, probably from association of the words <i>waste</i> and vast:
<i>waste</i> is applied also to uncultivated or unproductive land, if of
considerable extent; we speak of a <i>waste</i> track or region, but not
of a <i>waste</i> city lot. <i>Vacuous</i> refers to the condition of being

<p><i>Vain</i> (L. <i>vanus</i>, empty) keeps the etymological idea through

<p><i>Venal</i> (L. <i>venalis</i>, from <i>venum</i>, sale) signifies ready to sell one's

(L. <i>mercenarius</i>, from <i>merces</i>, pay, reward) signifies influenced
chiefly or only by desire for gain or reward; thus, etymologically,
the <i>mercenary</i> can be hired, while the <i>venal</i> are openly

The <i>hireling</i>, the <i>mercenary</i>, and the <i>venal</i> are alike in making
principle, conscience, and honor of less account than gold or sordid
considerations; but the <i>mercenary</i> and <i>venal</i> may be simply

own communion for another for any reward that could be offered
him. The <i>mercenary</i> may retain much show of independence;
<i>hireling</i> service sacrifices self-respect as well as principle; a public
officer who makes his office tributary to private speculation in
which he is interested is <i>mercenary</i>; if he receives a stipulated recompense

<p>In the highest sense, to <i>revere</i> or <i>reverence</i> is to hold in mingled

outward expression to the reverential feeling; we <i>revere</i> or <i>reverence</i>

or <i>venerate</i>. To <i>venerate</i> is to hold in exalted honor without
fear, and is applied to objects less removed from ourselves than
those we <i>revere</i>, being said especially of aged persons, of places

<p><i>Awe</i> is inspired by that in which there is sublimity or majesty
so overwhelming as to awaken a feeling akin to fear; in <i>awe</i>, considered
by itself, there is no element of esteem or affection, tho the
sense of vastness, power, or grandeur in the object is always
present. <i>Dread</i> is a shrinking apprehension or expectation of
possible harm awakened by any one of many objects or causes,
from that which is overwhelmingly vast and mighty to that which
is productive of momentary physical pain; in its higher uses
<i>dread</i> approaches the meaning of <i>awe</i>, but with more of chilliness
and cowering, and without that subjection of soul to the grandeur<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
and worthiness of the object that is involved in <i>awe</i>. <i>Awe</i> is preoccupied
with the object that inspires it; <i>dread</i> with apprehension
of personal consequences. <i>Reverence</i> and <i>veneration</i> are less
overwhelming than <i>awe</i> or <i>dread</i>, and suggest something of
esteem, affection, and personal nearness. We may feel <i>awe</i> of
that which we can not <i>reverence</i>, as a grandly terrible ocean
storm; <i>awe</i> of the divine presence is more distant and less trustful
than <i>reverence</i>. <i>Veneration</i> is commonly applied to things
which are not subjects of <i>awe</i>. <i>Adoration</i>, in its full sense, is
loftier than <i>veneration</i>, less restrained and awed than <i>reverence</i>,
and with more of the spirit of direct, active, and joyful worship.

<p><i>Venial</i> (L. <i>venia</i>, pardon) signifies capable of being pardoned,
and, in common use, capable of being readily pardoned, easily
overlooked. Aside from its technical ecclesiastical use, <i>venial</i> is
always understood as marking some fault comparatively <i>slight</i> or
<i>trivial</i>. A <i>venial</i> offense is one readily overlooked; a <i>pardonable</i>
offense requires more serious consideration, but on deliberation is
found to be susceptible of pardon. <i>Excusable</i> is scarcely applied
to offenses, but to matters open to doubt or criticism rather than
direct censure; so used, it often falls little short of justifiable;
as, I think, under those circumstances, his action was <i>excusable</i>.

<p><i>Oral</i> (L. <i>os</i>, the mouth) signifies uttered through the mouth or
(in common phrase) by word of mouth; <i>verbal</i> (L. <i>verbum</i>, a
word) signifies of, pertaining to, or connected with words, especially
with words as distinguished from the ideas they convey;
<i>vocal</i> (L. <i>vox</i>, the voice) signifies of or pertaining to the voice,
uttered or modulated by the voice, and especially uttered with or
sounding with full, resonant voice; <i>literal</i> (L. <i>litera</i>, a letter) signifies
consisting of or expressed by letters, or according to the
letter, in the broader sense of the exact meaning or requirement
of the words used; what is called "the letter of the law" is its
<i>literal</i> meaning without going behind what is expressed by the
letters on the page. Thus <i>oral</i> applies to that which is given by
spoken words in distinction from that which is written or printed;
as, <i>oral</i> tradition; an <i>oral</i> examination. By this rule we should
in strictness speak of an <i>oral</i> contract or an <i>oral</i> message, but
<i>verbal</i> contract and <i>verbal</i> message, as indicating that which is by
spoken rather than by written words, have become so fixed in the
language that they can probably never be changed; this usage is
also in line with other idioms of the language; as, "I give you
my <i>word</i>," "a true man's <i>word</i> is as good as his bond," "by <i>word</i>
of mouth," etc. A <i>verbal</i> translation may be <i>oral</i> or written, so
that it is word for word; a <i>literal</i> translation follows the construction
and idiom of the original as well as the words; a <i>literal</i><span class="pgn"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
translation is more than one that is merely <i>verbal</i>; both <i>verbal</i>
and <i>literal</i> are opposed to <i>free</i>. In the same sense, of attending
to words only, we speak of <i>verbal</i> criticism, a <i>verbal</i> change.
<i>Vocal</i> has primary reference to the human voice; as, <i>vocal</i> sounds,
<i>vocal</i> music; <i>vocal</i> may be applied within certain limits to inarticulate
sounds given forth by other animals than man; as, the
woods were <i>vocal</i> with the songs of birds; <i>oral</i> is never so applied,
but is limited to articulate utterance regarded as having a definite
meaning; as, an <i>oral</i> statement.</p>

<p><i>Vigilant</i> implies more sustained activity and more intelligent
volition than <i>alert</i>; one may be habitually <i>alert</i> by reason of
native quickness of perception and thought, or one may be momentarily
<i>alert</i> under some excitement or expectancy; one who
is <i>vigilant</i> is so with thoughtful purpose. One is <i>vigilant</i> against
danger or harm; he may be <i>alert</i> or <i>watchful</i> for good as well as
against evil; he is <i>wary</i> in view of suspected stratagem, trickery,
or treachery. A person may be <i>wakeful</i> because of some merely
physical excitement or excitability, as through insomnia; yet he
may be utterly careless and negligent in his wakefulness, the reverse
of <i>watchful</i>; a person who is truly <i>watchful</i> must keep himself<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
<i>wakeful</i> while on watch, in which case <i>wakeful</i> has something
of mental quality. <i>Watchful</i>, from the Saxon, and <i>vigilant</i>, from
the Latin, are almost exact equivalents; but <i>vigilant</i> has somewhat
more of sharp definiteness and somewhat more suggestion
of volition; one may be habitually <i>watchful</i>; one is <i>vigilant</i> of
set purpose and for direct cause, as in the presence of an enemy.

<p><i>Virtue</i> (L. <i>virtus</i>, primarily manly strength or courage, from
<i>vir</i>, a man, a hero) is, in its full sense, <i>goodness</i> that is victorious
through trial, perhaps through temptation and conflict.
<i>Goodness</i>, the being morally good, may be much less than <i>virtue</i>,
as lacking the strength that comes from trial and conflict,
or it may be very much more than <i>virtue</i>, as rising sublimely
above the possibility of temptation and conflict&mdash;the infantile
as contrasted with the divine <i>goodness</i>. <i>Virtue</i> is distinctively
human; we do not predicate it of God. <i>Morality</i> is conformity
to the moral law in action, whether in matters concerning ourselves
or others, whether with or without right principle. <i>Honesty</i>
and <i>probity</i> are used especially of one's relations to his fellow men,
<i>probity</i> being to <i>honesty</i> much what <i>virtue</i> in some respects is to
<i>goodness</i>; <i>probity</i> is <i>honesty</i> tried and proved, especially in those
things that are beyond the reach of legal requirement; above the
commercial sense, <i>honesty</i> may be applied to the highest truthfulness
of the soul to and with itself and its Maker. <i>Integrity</i>, in the
full sense, is moral wholeness without a flaw; when used, as it
often is, of contracts and dealings, it has reference to inherent
character and principle, and denotes much more than superficial
or conventional <i>honesty</i>. <i>Honor</i> is a lofty <i>honesty</i> that scorns
fraud or wrong as base and unworthy of itself. <i>Honor</i> rises far
above thought of the motto that "<i>honesty</i> is the best policy."
<i>Purity</i> is freedom from all admixture, especially of that which
debases; it is <i>chastity</i> both of heart and life, but of the life because<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
from the heart. <i>Duty</i>, the rendering of what is due to any
person or in any relation, is, in this connection, the fulfilment of
moral obligation. <i>Rectitude</i> and <i>righteousness</i> denote conformity
to the standard of right, whether in heart or act; <i>righteousness</i> is
used especially in the religious sense. <i>Uprightness</i> refers especially
to conduct. <i>Virtuousness</i> is a quality of the soul or of
action; in the latter sense it is the essence of virtuous action.

<p>To <i>wander</i> (AS. <i>windan</i>, wind) is to move in an indefinite or indeterminate
way which may or may not be a departure from a prescribed
way; to <i>deviate</i> (L. <i>de</i>, from, and <i>via</i>, a way) is to turn from
a prescribed or right way, physically, mentally, or morally, usually
in an unfavorable sense; to <i>diverge</i> (L. <i>di</i>, apart, and <i>vergo</i>, incline,
tend) is to turn from a course previously followed or that something
else follows, and has no unfavorable implication; to <i>digress</i>
(L. <i>di</i>, apart, aside, and <i>gradior</i>, step) is used only with reference
to speaking or writing; to <i>err</i> is used of intellectual or moral
action, and of the moral with primary reference to the intellectual,
an error being viewed as in some degree due to ignorance. <i>Range</i>,
<i>roam</i>, and <i>rove</i> imply the traversing of considerable, often of vast,
distances of land or sea; <i>range</i> commonly implies a purpose; as,
cattle <i>range</i> for food; a hunting-dog <i>ranges</i> a field for game.
<i>Roam</i> and <i>rove</i> are often purposeless, and always without definite
aim. To <i>swerve</i> or <i>veer</i> is to turn suddenly from a prescribed or previous
course, and often but momentarily; <i>veer</i> is more capricious
and repetitious; the horse <i>swerves</i> at the flash of a sword; the wind
<i>veers</i>; the ship <i>veers</i> with the wind. To <i>stray</i> is to go in a somewhat
purposeless way aside from the regular path or usual limits or
abode, usually with unfavorable implication; cattle <i>stray</i> from
their pastures; an author <i>strays</i> from his subject; one <i>strays</i> from
the path of virtue. <i>Stray</i> is in most uses a lighter word than
<i>wander</i>. <i>Ramble</i>, in its literal use, is always a word of pleasant
suggestion, but in its figurative use always somewhat contemptuous;
as, <i>rambling</i> talk.</p>

passing of hoofs and wheels in either direction is called the <i>track</i>.
A <i>passage</i> is between any two objects or lines of enclosure, a <i>pass</i>
commonly between mountains. A <i>driveway</i> is within enclosed

The other qualities are on the border-line. <i>Wisdom</i> has<span class="pgn"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
been defined as "the right use of <i>knowledge</i>," or "the use of the
most important means for attaining the best ends," <i>wisdom</i> thus
presupposing <i>knowledge</i> for its very existence and exercise. <i>Wisdom</i>
is mental power acting upon the materials that fullest <i>knowledge</i>
gives in the most effective way. There may be what is
termed "practical <i>wisdom</i>" that looks only to material results;
but in its full sense, <i>wisdom</i> implies the highest and noblest exercise
of all the faculties of the moral nature as well as of the intellect.
<i>Prudence</i> is a lower and more negative form of the same
virtue, respecting outward and practical matters, and largely with
a view of avoiding loss and injury; <i>wisdom</i> transcends <i>prudence</i>,
so that while the part of <i>prudence</i> is ordinarily also that of <i>wisdom</i>,
cases arise, as in the exigencies of business or of war, when
the highest <i>wisdom</i> is in the disregard of the maxims of <i>prudence</i>.
<i>Judgment</i>, the power of forming decisions, especially correct decisions,
is broader and more positive than <i>prudence</i>, leading one
to do, as readily as to refrain from doing; but <i>judgment</i> is more
limited in range and less exalted in character than <i>wisdom</i>; to
say of one that he displayed good <i>judgment</i> is much less than to
say that he manifested <i>wisdom</i>. <i>Skill</i> is far inferior to <i>wisdom</i>,
consisting largely in the practical application of acquired <i>knowledge</i>,
power, and habitual processes, or in the ingenious contrivance
that makes such application possible. In the making of
something perfectly useless there may be great <i>skill</i>, but no <i>wisdom</i>.

present time, especially when joined with <i>as</i>; we can say "he is
feeble <i>as yet</i>," or "he is <i>still</i> feeble," with scarcely appreciable
difference of meaning, except that the former statement implies
somewhat more of expectation than the latter. <i>Yet</i> with a negative
applies to completed action, often replacing a positive statement

<p><i>Boyish</i>, <i>childish</i>, and <i>girlish</i> are used in a good sense of those
to whom they properly belong, but in a bad sense of those from
whom more maturity is to be expected; <i>childish</i> eagerness or glee
is pleasing in a child, but unbecoming in a man; <i>puerile</i> in modern
use is distinctly contemptuous. <i>Juvenile</i> and <i>youthful</i> are
commonly used in a favorable and kindly sense in their application
to those still <i>young</i>; <i>youthful</i> in the sense of having the characteristics
of youth, hence fresh, vigorous, light-hearted, buoyant,
may have a favorable import as applied to any age, as when we
say the old man still retains his <i>youthful</i> ardor, vigor, or hopefulness;
<i>juvenile</i> in such use would belittle the statement. <i>Young</i>
is distinctively applied to those in the early stage of life or not
arrived at maturity. Compare <span class="smcl"><a href="#NEW">NEW</a></span>.</p>

<h2>SUGGESTIONS TO THE TEACHER.</h2>

<p>The following exercises have been prepared expressly and solely to accompany
the preceding text in which the distinctions of synonyms have been carefully pointed
out. It is not expected, intended, or desired that the questions should be answered
or the blanks in the examples supplied offhand. In such study nothing can be
worse than guesswork. Hence, leading questions have been avoided, and the order
of synonyms given in Part I. has frequently been departed from or reversed in
Part II.</p>

<p>To secure the study of Part I. before coming into class, pupils should not be
allowed to open it during recitation, unless on rare occasions to settle doubtful or
disputed points. The very best method will be found to be to have the examples
included in the lesson, with any others that may be added, copied on the blackboard
before recitation, and no books brought into class.</p>

<p>The <i>teacher</i> should make a thorough study of the subject, not only mastering
what is given in Part I., but going beyond the necessarily brief statements there
given, and consulting the ultimate authorities&mdash;the best dictionaries and the works
of the best speakers and writers. For the latter purpose a good cyclopedia of quotations,
like the Hoyt, will be found very helpful. The teacher should so study out
the subject as to be distinctly in advance of the class and able to speak authoritatively.
Such independent study will be found intensely interesting, and can be made
delightful and even fascinating to any intelligent class.</p>

<p>In answer to questions calling for definitive statement, the teacher should insist
upon the very words of the text, unless the pupil can give in his own words what is
manifestly as good. This will often be found not easy to do. Definition by synonym
should be absolutely forbidden.</p>

<p>Reasonable questions should be encouraged, but the class should not be allowed
to become a debating society. The meaning of English words is not a matter of
conjecture, and all disputed points should be promptly referred to the dictionary&mdash;usually
to be looked up after the recitation, and considered, if need be, at the next recitation.
The majority of them will not need to be referred to again, as the difficulties
will simply represent an inferior usage which the dictionary will brush aside. One
great advantage of synonym study is to exterminate colloquialisms.</p>

<p>The class should be encouraged to bring quotations from first-class authors with
blanks to be filled, such quotations being held authoritative, though not infallible;
also quotations from the best newspapers, periodicals, speeches, etc., with words
underlined for criticism, such quotations being held open to revision upon consultation
of authorities. The change of usage, whereby that may be correct to-day which
would not have been so at an earlier period, should be carefully noted, but always
upon the authority of an approved dictionary.</p>

<p>The examples have been in great part selected from the best literature, and all
others carefully prepared for this work. Hence, an appropriate word to fill each
blank can always be found by careful study of the corresponding group of synonyms.
In a few instances, either of two words would appropriately fill a blank and yield a
good sense. In such case, either should be accepted as correct, but the resulting
difference of meaning should be clearly pointed out.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
